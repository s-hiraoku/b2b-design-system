# Date-Aware Search Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of date-aware search functionality for CC-Deck project's custom slash commands and sub-agents, ensuring searches use current date information instead of hardcoded years.

## Problem Solved

Previously, agents performing searches would include hardcoded years like "2024" in search queries, leading to potentially outdated results. This implementation ensures all search queries use the current year (2025) and appropriate date ranges automatically.

## Components

### 1. Date Utility Agent (`.claude/agents/utility/date-utility.md`)

**Purpose**: Provides current date information for other agents to use in searches and time-sensitive operations.

**Key Features**:
- Extracts current date from environment context (`Today's date: 2025-08-06`)
- Provides multiple date formats (year, month, day, formatted dates)
- Generates search-appropriate date strings
- Supports both absolute and relative time references

**Usage by Other Agents**:
```markdown
# Call date utility agent first
Task: date-utility â†’ Returns current date information
# Use returned info in searches: "React best practices 2025"
```

### 2. Updated Research Agent (`.claude/agents/coding/research-agent.md`)

**Enhancements**:
- Added date-aware research process that calls date-utility agent first
- Updated search workflow to use current year in queries
- Added example integration showing proper usage pattern
- Modified all search examples to use dynamic date variables

**New Workflow**:
1. Get current date information from date-utility agent
2. Use returned date info in all subsequent search queries
3. Avoid hardcoded years in search terms

### 3. Settings Configuration (`.claude/settings.local.json`)

**New Section**:
```json
"searchDefaults": {
  "useCurrentDate": true,
  "dateUtilityAgent": "date-utility",
  "searchYearStrategy": "current_and_recent"
}
```

**Purpose**: 
- Centralized configuration for date-aware search behavior
- Defines which agent provides date information
- Sets strategy for year ranges in searches

### 4. Updated Coding Agent (`.claude/agents/coding/coding.md`)

**Modifications**:
- Added date-utility agent to sub-agent coordination list
- Updated research phase description to mention date-aware searches
- Ensures comprehensive coding workflows use current date information

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Automatic Currency**: All searches automatically use current year without manual updates
2. **Consistency**: Unified approach across all agents that perform searches
3. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for date logic
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to modify date strategies project-wide
5. **Future-Proof**: Automatically adapts as time progresses

## Usage Patterns

### For Agent Developers
When creating new agents that perform searches:

```markdown
## Research Workflow
1. **Date Context**: First call date-utility agent to get current date info
2. **Search Execution**: Use returned date information in search queries
3. **Example**: "topic best practices {current_year}" instead of "topic best practices 2024"
```

### For Search Queries
- Technology research: "framework_name guide 2025"
- Documentation: "library_name documentation 2025" 
- Problem solving: "error_message solution 2024-2025"

## Files Modified

1. **New**: `.claude/agents/utility/date-utility.md` - Date utility agent
2. **Updated**: `.claude/agents/coding/research-agent.md` - Date-aware research
3. **Updated**: `.claude/settings.local.json` - Search defaults configuration  
4. **Updated**: `.claude/agents/coding/coding.md` - Integration updates
5. **New**: `docs/date-aware-search.md` - This documentation

## Testing

The implementation can be tested by:

1. Calling the date-utility agent directly to verify date extraction
2. Using research-agent and observing search queries for current year usage
3. Verifying that settings.local.json searchDefaults are respected
4. Checking that other agents integrate the date-utility agent properly

## Future Enhancements

- Extend date-awareness to more agents as needed
- Add seasonal or quarterly date strategies for specific use cases
- Integration with project-specific date requirements
- Automated testing for date-aware functionality

This implementation provides a robust, maintainable solution for ensuring all search operations in the CC-Deck project use current and relevant date information.
