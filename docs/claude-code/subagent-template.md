## Template Usage Guidelines

### For agent-generator SubAgent

When generating dynamic SubAgents, use these templates as the foundation and customize based on:

1. **Project Analysis**: Technology stack detected from Kiro SDD specifications
2. **MCP Recommendations**: Specific MCP integrations approved by user
3. **Project Context**: Specific requirements and constraints from project specifications

### Customization Points

- **Project ID**: Replace `{project_id}` with actual project identifier
- **Agent Purpose**: Replace `{agent_purpose}` with specific functionality
- **MCP Integration**: Configure specific MCP tools and usage patterns
- **Context Schema**: Define project-specific context variables
- **Tool Configuration**: Include only necessary tools for the specific purpose

### Quality Standards

All generated SubAgents must meet:

- **Naming Convention**: `{project_id}-{agent_purpose}` format
- **YAML Compliance**: Valid frontmatter with required fields
- **Context Integration**: Proper Smart Context reading and storage
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation strategies
- **Documentation**: Clear usage patterns and best practices

## Integration with CC-Deck Workflow Engine

These templates are designed to work seamlessly with:

- **Development Environment Setup Workflow**: Dynamic generation during agent_generation phase
- **Smart Context Propagation**: Cross-agent communication and data sharing
- **Workflow Integration**: Proper integration with Enhanced Coding Workflow
- **Quality Assurance**: Consistent structure and error handling patterns

Use these templates to ensure consistent, high-quality SubAgent generation that integrates properly with the CC-Deck platform architecture.
