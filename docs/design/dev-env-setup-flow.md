# Development Environment Setup Flow Design

## Overview

The Development Environment Setup Flow is a new workflow that bridges the gap between Kiro SDD specification completion and the Coding workflow. This flow dynamically creates project-specific MCP SubAgents to optimize the development process based on the project's technical requirements.

## Workflow Position

    A[üéØ Kiro SDD Workflow] --> B[üõ†Ô∏è Dev Environment Setup] --> C[üíª Coding Workflow]
    D[üìã Specifications] --> B
    B --> E[ü§ñ Dynamic MCP Agents]
    E --> C
```

**New Flow**: `kiro-sdd ‚Üí dev-env-setup ‚Üí coding`

## Core Concept

Instead of using only default MCP integrations (DeepWiki, Context7, Serena), the system will:

1. **Analyze** the project specifications
2. **Recommend** relevant MCP-based SubAgents  
3. **Generate** custom SubAgents for the specific project
4. **Integrate** them into the Coding workflow dynamically

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Infrastructure Complete
- ‚úÖ **Workflow Definition**: `dev-env-setup.yaml` created with 6 phases
- ‚úÖ **SubAgent Creation**: 4 specialized SubAgents implemented
  - `spec-analyzer`: Analyzes Kiro SDD specifications 
  - `mcp-recommender`: Researches and recommends MCP agents
  - `agent-generator`: Generates custom SubAgent files
  - `workflow-integrator`: Creates extension configs and merges workflows
- ‚úÖ **Custom Command**: `/dev-env-setup` command documentation created
- ‚úÖ **Workflow Chain**: `kiro-sdd.yaml` updated to chain to `dev-env-setup`

### ‚ùå Phase 2: Workflow Engine Missing
- ‚ùå **YAML Execution Engine**: No engine to read and execute workflow phases
- ‚ùå **Dynamic Directory Creation**: Directory structure not created at runtime
- ‚ùå **Agent Orchestration**: SubAgents not being called in sequence
- ‚ùå **Smart Context**: Context propagation between phases not implemented

### Implementation Steps (Actual Process)

#### ‚úÖ 1. Specification Analysis (spec-analyzer SubAgent)
**Status**: Agent defined, execution engine missing
- Read `.kiro/specs/{project_id}/requirements.md`
- Read `.kiro/specs/{project_id}/design.md`  
- Extract technology stack, frameworks, and tools
- Identify integration points and optimization opportunities

#### ‚úÖ 2. MCP Agent Recommendation (mcp-recommender SubAgent)  
**Status**: Agent defined, execution engine missing
- Use Web Search, DeepWiki MCP, Context7 MCP to research optimal tools
- Generate list of potential MCP SubAgents
- Example recommendations:
  ```yaml
  # For Next.js + Vercel + Supabase project
  recommended_agents:
    - vercel-mcp-agent: "Vercel deployment optimization"
    - supabase-mcp-agent: "Database and auth integration"
    - nextjs-optimizer: "Next.js App Router performance"
    - tailwind-helper: "CSS utility optimization"
  ```

#### ‚úÖ 3. User Approval (human_interaction phase)
**Status**: Defined in YAML, execution engine missing
- Present recommendations to user with clear explanations
- Allow user to approve/reject individual agents  
- Provide rationale for each recommendation

#### ‚úÖ 4. Dynamic Agent Generation (agent-generator SubAgent)
**Status**: Agent defined, execution engine missing
- Create SubAgent files in `.claude/agents/coding/dynamic/{project_id}/`
- Generate with proper naming: `{project_id}-{agent_name}`
- Include appropriate MCP tool integrations and usage patterns

#### ‚úÖ 5. Workflow Integration (workflow-integrator SubAgent)
**Status**: Agent defined, execution engine missing
- Create extension configuration
- Merge with base Coding workflow
- Execute enhanced workflow with project-specific agents

#### ‚ùå 6. Workflow Engine Implementation
**Status**: Missing - Critical Gap**
- YAML workflow parser and execution engine
- Sequential phase execution with context propagation
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Dynamic directory creation during execution

## File Structure Design

### Directory Layout
```bash
.cc-deck/runtime/projects/{project_id}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extensions/                    # Extension configs (manual/generated)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ coding-extension.yaml     # Coding workflow extensions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/generated/           # Merged configs (auto-generated)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ coding-merged.yaml        # Final workflow configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/                       # Generated SubAgents
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {project_id}-vercel-agent.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {project_id}-nextjs-optimizer.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {project_id}-tailwind-helper.md
```

### Configuration Flow
1. **Base Configuration**: `.cc-deck/config/workflows/coding.yaml` (immutable)
2. **Extension Configuration**: `dynamic/{project_id}/extensions/coding-extension.yaml`
3. **Merged Configuration**: `dynamic/{project_id}/generated/coding-merged.yaml`
4. **Workflow Execution**: Uses merged configuration

## Technical Design Decisions

### Q1: Configuration Management - Hybrid File Generation
**Decision**: Generate merged workflow files for persistence and debugging

**Rationale**: 
- Provides clear visibility into final configuration
- Enables debugging and troubleshooting
- Maintains separation between base and project-specific configs
- Avoids complex runtime merging on every execution

### Q2: Agent Discovery - Workflow Integration
**Decision**: Add dynamic agents to workflow definition at load time

**Implementation**:
```yaml
# Base coding.yaml supporting_agents
supporting_agents:
  - research-agent
  - deepwiki-research-solver

# Extended with dynamic agents  
supporting_agents: # After merge
  - research-agent
  - deepwiki-research-solver
  - {project_id}-vercel-agent      # Added dynamically
  - {project_id}-nextjs-optimizer  # Added dynamically
```

### Q3: Dependency Management - Order + Context Sharing
**Decision**: Hybrid approach using execution order + Smart Context

**Implementation**:
- **Simple Dependencies**: Control through array ordering
- **Complex Dependencies**: Agents read previous results from Smart Context
- **Loose Coupling**: No direct agent-to-agent communication

```python
# Example: Vercel agent uses Next.js analysis results
nextjs_analysis = context.get("nextjs_analysis_result")
if nextjs_analysis and nextjs_analysis.get("app_router"):
    # Generate App Router optimized Vercel config
```

### Q4: Error Handling - Graceful Degradation
**Decision**: Continue execution when MCP agents fail

**Implementation**:
```python
try:
    result = Task(dynamic_agent)
    context.store(f"{agent}_result", result)
except Exception as e:
    warning = f"‚ö†Ô∏è {agent} failed: {e}. Continuing without this optimization."
    context.store(f"{agent}_result", None)
    continue  # Skip failed agent, continue workflow
```
