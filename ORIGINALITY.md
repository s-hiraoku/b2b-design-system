# Originality and Independence Statement

## Project Independence

CC-Deck is an entirely original and independent implementation of AI-driven development platform concepts. While we acknowledge inspiration from various open-source projects and methodologies, all code, implementations, and unique features are our original work.

## Independent Implementations

### Kiro SDD (Specification-Driven Development)
Our Kiro SDD implementation is significantly based on gotalab/claude-code-spec:
- **Directory Structure**: `.kiro/` structure is adapted from their specification approach
- **Workflow Patterns**: Phase-based development (requirements → design → tasks) follows their methodology
- **Specification Format**: Our spec file organization is influenced by their patterns
- **Original Additions**: 
  - Integration with Claude Code and MCP systems
  - Multi-agent orchestration and delegation patterns
  - AI-driven approval workflows
  - Automated task progression and state management

**Attribution**: The Kiro SDD methodology is substantially based on concepts and patterns from gotalab/claude-code-spec. While our implementation code is original and includes many unique features, the core SDD approach and workflow design are adapted from their work.

### Similarity Analysis
Our similarity-refactoring system is implemented entirely through:
- Serena MCP's semantic analysis tools for code understanding
- Original pattern detection and similarity analysis algorithms
- Custom refactoring orchestration and workflow logic
- Proprietary quality validation and integration mechanisms

**Conceptual Inspiration**: While inspired by similarity analysis methodologies (including concepts from mizchi/similarity), our implementation is completely independent and uses different technical approaches through Serena MCP tools and original algorithms.

### Unique Technical Features

1. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: 43 specialized sub-agents with unique coordination patterns
2. **MCP Integration**: Novel integration of multiple MCP services (DeepWiki, Context7, Serena, Playwright)
3. **Anthropic Compliance**: Full compliance with Anthropic's sub-agent specifications
4. **Dynamic Agent Selection**: Original context-based agent selection algorithms
5. **Quality-Driven Workflows**: Proprietary feedback loops and quality assessment systems
6. **State Management**: Original Kiro SDD state synchronization and management

## Intellectual Property Respect

We respect all intellectual property rights and have taken measures to ensure:
- No code copying or derivation from referenced projects
- Proper attribution of conceptual inspirations
- Clear distinction between inspiration and implementation
- Independent development of all functional components

## Contact
