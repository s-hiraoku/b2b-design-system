## Purpose

This directory contains the CC-Deck Workflow Engine that enables:

1. **Workflow Orchestration**: Base workflow definitions with extensible templates
2. **Smart Context System**: Advanced context management with cross-workflow state sharing  
3. **Unified Standards**: Consistent error handling, monitoring, and quality assurance
4. **Dynamic Agent Support**: Project-specific MCP agent generation and integration
5. **Development Tools**: CLI tools and runtime management for workflow execution

## Key Features

### ðŸ”§ Smart Context Management
- **Cross-workflow state persistence**: Context preserved across sessions
- **Agent memory sharing**: Agents communicate and learn from each other  
- **User preference learning**: System adapts to user choices and patterns
- **Quality metrics tracking**: Continuous improvement through measurement

### ðŸŽ¯ Workflow Engine
- **Template-based creation**: Standardized workflow and agent generation
- **Project-agnostic design**: Scalable architecture for multiple projects
- **Error recovery**: Automatic checkpoints and recovery mechanisms
- **Quality gates**: Integrated quality assurance throughout execution

## Integration with Kiro SDD

The CC-Deck workflow engine integrates with Kiro SDD by:

- Respecting the `.kiro/` directory structure for specifications
- Reading and updating `tasks.md` files for implementation tracking
- Using `kiro_status.json` for phase management
- Maintaining separation between SDD process and orchestration logic

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Smart Context management
node .cc-deck/src/cli/smart-context-cli.js init <project-id> <workflow>
node .cc-deck/src/cli/smart-context-cli.js show <project-id>
node .cc-deck/src/cli/smart-context-cli.js stats

# Workflow execution via orchestrator
/orchestrator                    # Intelligent workflow selection
/orchestrator "resume project"   # Resume interrupted workflow  
/orchestrator "coding feature"   # Specific workflow execution
```

### Integration Points

The CC-Deck Workflow Engine integrates with:

- **`/orchestrator` command**: Main entry point for workflow execution
- **Claude Code agents**: Enhanced with Smart Context awareness
- **Kiro SDD process**: Seamless `.kiro/specs/*/tasks.md` integration
- **MCP services**: Advanced service integration and optimization
