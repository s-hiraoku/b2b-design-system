        - "Map specifications to aesthetic platform implementation artifacts"
      
      japanese_implementation_verification:
        - "Analyze implemented aesthetic platform code against specification requirements"
        - "Verify API endpoints match aesthetic platform specification definitions"

        - "Check IIIF compliance and optimization"
        - "Validate Three.js virtual gallery implementation"
        - "Verify multi-library animation orchestration"
      
      japanese_tasks_completion_check:
        - "Parse tasks.md file for aesthetic platform completion status"
        - "Verify all mandatory aesthetic platform tasks are marked complete"
        - "Identify incomplete or skipped aesthetic tasks"
        - "Cross-reference aesthetic tasks with actual implementation"
      
      japanese_gap_analysis:
        - "Identify missing aesthetic features from specifications"
        - "Detect implementation deviations from Japanese aesthetic requirements"
        - "Flag incomplete or partial aesthetic implementations"
