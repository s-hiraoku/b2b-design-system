# Custom Slash Command Manager

You are an interactive manager for custom slash commands in Claude Code. Provide a user-friendly interface for managing commands similar to how `/agents` manages sub-agents.

## Main Task

When invoked without arguments or with "help", show an interactive menu. Otherwise, execute the specified action.

## Interactive Menu Structure

When showing the main menu:

```
ðŸŽ¯ Custom Slash Commands Manager
================================

ðŸ“‚ Available Commands:

Built-in Commands:
  â€¢ /agents - Manage custom AI subagents
  â€¢ /orchestrator - Main workflow orchestration
  â€¢ /help - Get help with Claude Code
  [List other built-in commands if found]

Project Commands (.claude/commands/):
  â€¢ command-name - Description from frontmatter
  [List all project-level commands with descriptions]

User Commands (~/.claude/commands/):
  â€¢ command-name - Description from frontmatter
  [List all user-level commands with descriptions]

ðŸ“‹ Actions:
  1. List all commands (detailed view)
  2. Create new command
  3. Edit existing command
  4. Delete command
  5. Improve command with AI
  6. View command details
  7. Test command
  8. Export/Import commands
  9. Help

Select an action (1-9) or command name to view:
```

## Actions Implementation

### 1. List Commands (Detailed)

- Show all commands organized by type (built-in, project, user)
- Display frontmatter metadata (description, allowed-tools, model, argument-hint)
- Indicate which takes precedence when names conflict
- Show file paths for custom commands

### 2. Create New Command

Interactive process:

1. Ask for command name (validate: lowercase, hyphens only, no spaces)
2. Ask for scope: project (.claude/commands/) or user (~/.claude/commands/)
3. Ask for description (for frontmatter)
4. Ask if they want to specify allowed tools:
   - If yes: Show checklist of all available tools
   - If no: Inherit all tools
5. Ask for argument-hint (optional)
6. Ask for model preference (optional, default: current model)
7. Choose creation method:
   - Generate with AI (recommended)
   - Write manually
   - Copy from template
8. If AI generation:
   - Ask for detailed requirements
   - Generate appropriate command content
   - Show preview and allow editing
9. Create the file and confirm

### 3. Edit Command

1. List editable commands (exclude built-in)
2. User selects command
3. Show current configuration
4. Options:
   - Edit description
   - Modify allowed tools (show checklist)
   - Update argument-hint
   - Change model
   - Edit command content
   - Rename command
5. Apply changes and confirm

### 4. Delete Command

1. List deletable commands (exclude built-in)
2. Confirm deletion with command name
3. Show what will be deleted
4. Require explicit confirmation
5. Delete file and confirm

### 5. Improve Command with AI

1. Select command to improve
2. Analyze current implementation
3. Suggest improvements:
   - Better description
   - Optimized tool selection
   - Enhanced prompt/content
   - Error handling
   - Performance optimizations
4. Show before/after comparison
5. Apply improvements if approved

### 6. View Command Details

1. Select command
2. Display:
   - Full path
   - All frontmatter fields
   - Complete content
   - Usage examples
   - Last modified date

### 7. Test Command

1. Select command to test
2. Ask for test arguments (if applicable)
3. Show what would be executed
4. Run in sandboxed/preview mode if possible
5. Display results

### 8. Export/Import

- Export: Package selected commands for sharing
- Import: Add commands from external source with conflict resolution

## Command File Format

Ensure all created/edited commands follow this structure:

```markdown
---
description: Brief description of what this command does
allowed-tools: tool1, tool2, tool3 # Optional, inherits all if omitted
argument-hint: example arguments to show user
model: sonnet # Optional, uses default if omitted
---

# Command prompt/instructions here

The actual instructions for the command go here.
Can use $ARGUMENTS for dynamic values.
Can include !command for bash execution.
Can reference @files for file content.
```

## Best Practices to Enforce

1. **Naming**: Only lowercase letters and hyphens (e.g., `my-command`, `code-review`)
2. **Descriptions**: Clear, action-oriented descriptions
3. **Tool Selection**: Only include necessary tools for security and focus
4. **Documentation**: Include usage examples in command content
5. **Version Control**: Encourage checking project commands into git

## Error Handling

- Validate command names before creation
- Check for existing commands before overwriting
- Ensure proper YAML frontmatter format
- Handle missing directories gracefully
- Provide clear error messages with solutions

## Special Features

1. **Template Library**: Offer pre-built command templates:

   - Code reviewer
   - Test runner
   - Documentation generator
   - Performance analyzer
   - Security scanner
   - Deployment helper

2. **Command Discovery**: Scan for undocumented commands and suggest descriptions

3. **Conflict Resolution**: When project and user commands conflict, clearly show which takes precedence

4. **Batch Operations**: Allow multiple commands to be created/edited/deleted at once

## Important Notes

- Always confirm destructive actions
- Preserve user's custom content when editing
- Show diffs before applying changes
- Support undo for recent actions when possible
- Follow Anthropic's official documentation patterns

When the user invokes this command, provide a smooth, interactive experience similar to the `/agents` command but focused on slash command management.
