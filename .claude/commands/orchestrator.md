# Orchestrator Command

Intelligent orchestrator that automatically detects project state and continues development workflow from the appropriate phase using task-based progression.

## Quality Commitment

**We make no compromises in creating high-quality products. We build exceptional products that adhere to specifications with uncompromising excellence.**

This orchestrator is designed to deliver enterprise-grade development workflows with the highest standards of quality, testing, and architectural integrity.

## Purpose

This command serves as the single entry point for all development workflows by:

1. **Analyzing project state** (checking existing specifications, tasks.md files, code)
2. **Determining next phase** (identifying what needs to be done next)  
3. **Enforcing human approval checkpoints** (NEVER bypassing approval gates)
4. **Delegating to appropriate agent** (executing the right workflow)
5. **Maintaining continuity** (preserving context between phases)

## üö® Approval Management

**Core Rule**: Never proceed to implementation or next workflow without explicit human approval.

### Approval Requirements:

1. **Before TDD Implementation**: Implementation task approval required
2. **Before Next Workflow**: Current workflow completion approval required  
3. **Implementation Directory**: All code must be created in `projects/{project-name}/src/` directory

### Approval Process:
- Check if current phase requires approval
- Present comprehensive review materials to user
- Wait for explicit "yes" or "approved" confirmation
- Proceed only after receiving approval
- Log all approval decisions for audit trail

## üîÑ Complete Workflow Management

**Full Development Flow**: kiro-sdd ‚Üí coding ‚Üí refactoring ‚Üí testing ‚Üí pr ‚Üí acceptance

This orchestrator executes the complete flow through approvals, never stopping at single workflow.

1. **Workflow Completion Detection**: Detect approval completion of each phase
2. **Multi-Agent Phase Execution**: Execute ALL defined phases within each workflow using appropriate agents
3. **Automatic Next Phase Start**: Execute next workflow immediately after approval
4. **Progress Visualization**: Display current position and remaining phases
5. **Continue Until Acceptance**: Never stop before final acceptance approval

## ü§ñ Multi-Agent Execution Strategy

**Within Each Workflow**: Execute ALL defined phases sequentially using the specified agents:

### Coding Workflow Example:
- **Phase 1**: research-agent (technology research using MCP integrations)
- **Phase 2**: planning-agent (architecture and implementation strategy)
- **Phase 3**: serena-onboarding-agent (Serena MCP initialization)
- **Phase 4**: tdd-agent (TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycles)
- **Phase 5**: implementation-agent (complete TDD-based implementation)
- **Phase 6**: testing-agent (comprehensive testing strategy)
- **Phase 7**: documentation-agent (generate comprehensive documentation)
- **Phase 8**: Human approval checkpoint

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT execute only tdd-agent. Execute the COMPLETE workflow sequence using ALL specified agents in the correct order.

### Agent Selection Criteria:

**When to use research-agent**:
- New features requiring technology research
- Need to evaluate libraries, frameworks, or best practices
- Complex projects requiring architectural decisions

**When to use planning-agent**:
- After research phase completion
- Need to create implementation strategy
- Architecture design required

**When to use serena-onboarding-agent**:
- Before any implementation begins
- Need to establish project context in Serena MCP
- Setting up TDD development environment

**When to use tdd-agent**:
- After Serena onboarding completion
- Implementing core functionality using Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- Building test-driven foundation

**When to use implementation-agent**:
- After TDD cycles create foundation
- Need to complete full production implementation
- Expanding functionality while maintaining tests

**When to use testing-agent**:
- After implementation completion
- Need comprehensive testing strategy beyond TDD
- Integration and E2E test requirements

**When to use documentation-agent**:
- After implementation and testing completion
- Need API documentation, tutorials, examples
- Final documentation before approval

## Intelligent State Detection & Dynamic Agent Selection

### Automatic Project Analysis

When invoked without specific parameters, orchestrator will:

1. **Check for existing specifications** in `.kiro/specs/` directory
2. **Analyze tasks.md files** for active development tasks and completion status
3. **Review code changes** and implementation progress
4. **Determine current phase** and recommend next steps
5. **Select optimal agent** based on context and complexity

```bash
# Automatic state detection and continuation
/orchestrator

# Example output:
# üîç Analyzing project state...
# ‚úÖ Found feature: user-auth-system
# üìã Current phase: Implementation (7/12 tasks completed)
# üß† Context analysis: High complexity, security-critical
# üéØ Agent selection: tdd-agent (TDD approach for security)
# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  Proceeding with TDD implementation...
```

### Context-Based Agent Selection

Intelligent agent selection based on project context and requirements:

Based on project analysis, the orchestrator selects the most appropriate workflow agent:

- **Security-critical development**: Use `tdd-agent` for comprehensive security testing with TDD approach
- **Complex refactoring needs**: Use `refactoring` agent for systematic code improvement workflows
- **API or service development**: Use `integration-test` agent for comprehensive API testing
- **New feature development**: Use `coding` agent for full development lifecycle management
- **Documentation requirements**: Use `documentation-agent` for comprehensive documentation generation
- **Structured development**: Use `kiro-spec-orchestrator` for specification-driven development workflow

### Agent Selection Criteria

The orchestrator analyzes project characteristics to determine optimal delegation:

1. **Code complexity analysis**: Assess existing codebase complexity and maintenance needs
2. **Security requirements**: Identify authentication, authorization, and security-sensitive code
3. **Integration patterns**: Detect APIs, external services, and integration requirements
4. **Development phase**: Determine whether project needs research, implementation, testing, or documentation
5. **Quality status**: Assess current code quality and improvement opportunities

### Workflow Coordination

For complex scenarios requiring multiple workflows:

- **Refactoring + Testing**: Coordinate code improvement with comprehensive testing
- **Documentation + PR Creation**: Ensure documentation updates are included in pull requests
- **Implementation + Quality Assurance**: Combine development with continuous quality validation
- **Research + Planning**: Integrate technology research with strategic planning

The orchestrator ensures proper sequencing and context sharing between different workflow phases.

### State Detection Logic

```yaml
Project State Analysis:
  0. Check Serena MCP Status:
    - New project ‚Üí Initialize Serena MCP with mcp__serena__initial_instructions
    - Existing project ‚Üí Load context with mcp__serena__list_memories
    - Context stale ‚Üí Refresh project understanding

  1. Check Specifications:
    - No specs ‚Üí Start with Kiro Steering
    - Incomplete spec ‚Üí Resume from last phase
    - Complete spec ‚Üí Check tasks.md status

  2. Validate State Consistency:
    - Compare kiro_status.json with actual project state
    - Detect implementation ahead of kiro status
    - Detect approval blocks preventing progression
    - Auto-sync status when implementation detected

  3. Check Implementation (tasks.md):
    - No tasks.md ‚Üí Create tasks from specs
    - Incomplete tasks ‚Üí Continue with next uncompleted task
    - All tasks completed ‚Üí Ready for next feature/enhancement
    - Implementation exists but tasks unmarked ‚Üí Auto-update task progress

  4. Auto-Resolve Status Inconsistencies:
    - Detect created files/code vs task completion status
    - Auto-approve completed phases when implementation verified
    - Update kiro_status.json current_phase to match reality
    - Trigger TDD-agent completion when implementation done

  5. Check Next Work:
    - All tasks complete ‚Üí Analyze for new features or improvements
    - Tasks in progress ‚Üí Focus on current implementation
    - Blocked tasks ‚Üí Identify and resolve blockers

  6. Check Quality:
    - Implementation complete ‚Üí Run tests and validation
    - Tests failing ‚Üí Debug and fix issues
    - Tests passing ‚Üí Mark tasks as completed

  7. Check Documentation:
    - Code complete ‚Üí Update documentation
    - Documentation ready ‚Üí Final validation
    - All complete ‚Üí Ready for new work cycle
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Smart Workflow Continuation

1. **State Analysis Phase**

   ```bash
   # Analyze project structure
   - Check .kiro/specs/ directory for feature specifications
   - Read tasks.md files for implementation progress
   - Analyze task completion status (checkboxes)
   - Determine optimal next action
   ```

2. **Context Preservation**

   ```bash
   # Maintain workflow context
   - Feature name from existing specs
   - Current task from tasks.md progress
   - Completed tasks from checkbox status
   - Next logical task from task hierarchy
   ```

3. **Intelligent Delegation**
   ```bash
   # Delegate to appropriate phase (with Serena MCP integration)
   - New project ‚Üí Serena MCP initialization ‚Üí Kiro workflow
   - Missing specs ‚Üí Kiro workflow (Steering ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Tasks)
   - Missing tasks.md ‚Üí Generate implementation tasks
   - Incomplete tasks ‚Üí Continue implementation (with Serena context)
   - All tasks complete ‚Üí Identify next feature/enhancement
   - Code complete ‚Üí Testing and validation
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Continuation

```bash
# Continue from where you left off - executes complete flow
/orchestrator

# Force specific phase
/orchestrator "continue coding user-auth-system"

# Start new feature - automatically executes kiro-sdd ‚Üí coding ‚Üí refactoring ‚Üí testing ‚Üí pr ‚Üí acceptance
/orchestrator "Build a real-time chat application"
```


### Phase-Specific Execution

```bash
# Jump to specific phase
/orchestrator "kiro:spec-design user-auth"      # Continue with design
/orchestrator "create-issues payment-system"    # Create issues for existing spec
/orchestrator "coding authentication-module"    # Start implementation
/orchestrator "acceptance user-management"      # Run acceptance tests
/orchestrator "pr-merge 123"                   # Merge approved PR
```

## Workflow State Management

### State Files and Tracking

The orchestrator maintains project state through several mechanisms:

```yaml
State Storage:
  .kiro/specs/{feature}/kiro_status.json:
    - current_phase: "design|requirements|tasks|etc"
    - completed_phases: ["steering", "init", "requirements"]
    - last_updated: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    - next_recommended: "tasks"

  .claude/workflow-state.json:
    - active_feature: "user-auth-system"
    - active_issues: [123, 124, 125]
    - completed_issues: [120, 121, 122]
    - current_pr: 456
    - workflow_phase: "implementation"
```

### Automatic Next Step Detection

When `/orchestrator` is called without parameters:

1. **Scan for Active Features**

   ```bash
   # Check specs directory
   ls .kiro/specs/*/kiro_status.json
   # Identify features in progress
   # Select most recently updated
   ```

2. **Determine Current Phase**

   ```bash
   # Read kiro_status.json
   # Check completed vs pending phases
   # Identify blockers or dependencies
   ```

3. **Recommend Next Action**
   ```bash
   # Based on phase completion:
   - Steering done ‚Üí Requirements
   - Requirements done ‚Üí Design
   - Design done ‚Üí Tasks
   - Tasks created ‚Üí Implementation
   - All tasks complete ‚Üí Next Issue Selection
   - Issue selected ‚Üí New Kiro Workflow
   - Implementation done ‚Üí Testing
   - Testing done ‚Üí Acceptance
   - Acceptance done ‚Üí PR Creation
   - PR created ‚Üí Merge
   - Merged ‚Üí Next Issue
   ```

### Example Workflow Continuation

```bash
# First time - starts from beginning
/orchestrator
# Output: "No active features found. Starting with Kiro Steering..."

# After steering completed
/orchestrator
# Output: "Found project context. Proceeding with feature initialization..."

# After several phases completed
/orchestrator
# Output: "Feature 'user-auth' at Design phase. Continuing with task generation..."

# With active development
/orchestrator
# Output: "Found 3 incomplete tasks for 'user-auth'. Checking implementation progress..."
```

## Sub-Agent Architecture Benefits

- **Focused Responsibility**: Orchestrator handles state detection and delegation
- **Intelligent Continuation**: Automatically resumes from last successful phase
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains workflow state across sessions
- **Flexible Progression**: Allows jumping to specific phases when needed
- **Progress Visibility**: Clear indication of current state and next steps

This pattern enables seamless workflow continuation without manual state tracking.

## Tasks.md Progress Tracking Integration

### Task-Based Development Workflow

The orchestrator focuses on .kiro/specs/{feature}/tasks.md files for tracking implementation progress:

```bash
# Continue from current task progress
/orchestrator

# Update specific task completion
/orchestrator "complete-task feature-name 1.1"

# Work on next uncompleted task
/orchestrator "next-task feature-name"
```

### Core Task Management

- **Primary Focus**: Track progress through tasks.md checkbox completion
- **Automatic Detection**: Identify next uncompleted task automatically
- **Progress Visualization**: Display current completion status
- **Smart Continuation**: Resume from last incomplete task

### Tasks.md File Structure and Format

.kiro/specs/{feature}/tasks.md files follow a hierarchical checkbox format for tracking implementation progress:

```markdown

### Task Progress Update Process

#### Automatic Task Completion Detection

The orchestrator automatically detects task completion by:

1. **Analyzing Code Changes**: Comparing implemented functionality against task requirements
2. **Checking Test Coverage**: Verifying tests exist for completed tasks
3. **Validating Requirements**: Ensuring task acceptance criteria are met
4. **Updating Checkboxes**: Automatically updating `[ ]` to `[x]` for completed tasks

#### Manual Task Progress Updates

```bash
# Update specific task completion
/orchestrator "complete-task feature-name 1.1"

# Mark multiple tasks as completed
/orchestrator "complete-tasks feature-name 1.1,1.2,2.3"

# Update task progress with validation
/orchestrator "update-progress feature-name --validate"
```

#### Progress Tracking Commands

```bash
# Check current task progress
/orchestrator "task-status feature-name"

# Generate progress report

```

#### Integration with Development Workflow

The tasks.md progress tracking integrates seamlessly with the development workflow:

1. **Task Selection**: Automatically identifies next logical task to implement
2. **Context Preservation**: Maintains task context across development sessions
3. **Dependency Management**: Ensures prerequisite tasks are completed first
4. **Progress Continuity**: Resumes development from the last completed task

### Task Completion and Next Feature Workflow

#### Automatic Next Feature Identification

When all tasks in a tasks.md file are completed, the orchestrator automatically:

1. **Validates Complete Task Completion**: Ensures all checkboxes are marked as completed
2. **Analyzes Project State**: Reviews current codebase and documentation
3. **Identifies Improvements**: Suggests enhancements, optimizations, or new features
4. **Presents Options**: Shows potential next development areas
5. **Requests User Decision**: Waits for user direction on next focus area

```bash
# Automatic flow when tasks complete
/orchestrator
# Output: "All tasks completed for 'user-auth-system'!"
# Output: "Analyzing project for potential improvements..."
# Output: "Suggested next development areas:"
# Output: "1. Performance optimizations"
# Output: "2. UI/UX enhancements"
# Output: "3. Additional security features"
# Output: "4. New feature development"
# Output: "What would you like to focus on next?"
```

#### Manual Next Feature Selection

```bash
# Force next feature analysis
/orchestrator "next-feature feature-name"

# Suggest improvements for specific area
/orchestrator "suggest-improvements authentication"

# Start new feature development
/orchestrator "new-feature user-profile-management"
```

## CC-Deck Workflow Engine Integration

### Enhanced Workflow Orchestration

The orchestrator now integrates with the CC-Deck Workflow Engine to provide advanced workflow composition and smart context propagation capabilities as designed in `docs/CC-DECK-DESIGN.md`.

#### Workflow-Driven Execution

When complex workflows are detected or explicitly requested, the orchestrator leverages workflow definitions from `.cc-deck/config/workflows/` to execute sophisticated multi-agent processes:

```bash
# Workflow-driven execution examples
/orchestrator                              # Intelligent workflow selection
/orchestrator "kiro-sdd user authentication"  # Explicit Kiro SDD workflow
/orchestrator "coding REST API service"        # Coding workflow
/orchestrator "refactoring legacy-system"      # Refactoring workflow
```

#### Smart Context Propagation

The orchestrator maintains workflow context across agent executions using the Smart Context system:

- **Context Persistence**: Workflow state saved in `.cc-deck/runtime/context/`
- **Cross-Agent Communication**: Results propagated between agents automatically
- **Resume Capability**: Interrupted workflows can be resumed from checkpoints
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into workflow progression

### Workflow Selection Logic

The orchestrator uses intelligent analysis to select appropriate workflows:

```yaml
Workflow Selection Rules:
  project_analysis:
    - has_kiro_specs: kiro-sdd-workflow
    - code_quality_issues: refactoring-workflow
    - test_coverage_low: testing-workflow
    - new_development: coding-workflow
    - pr_creation_needed: pr-workflow
    - stakeholder_review_required: acceptance-workflow

  explicit_keywords:
    - "kiro|sdd|spec": kiro-sdd-workflow
    - "code|coding|implement": coding-workflow
    - "refactor|clean|optimize": refactoring-workflow
    - "test|testing|quality": testing-workflow
    - "pr|pull.request|merge": pr-workflow
    - "accept|approval|review": acceptance-workflow
```

### Implementation Strategy

The CC-Deck integration follows a **gradual enhancement approach**:

#### Phase 1: Basic Workflow Engine (Current)

- Load and parse workflow definitions from `.cc-deck/config/workflows/`
- Implement Smart Context for state management
- Basic sequential phase execution with agent delegation

#### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Next)

- Task-driven execution with `tasks.md` integration
- Conditional workflow branching and parallel execution
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

#### Phase 3: Full Integration (Future)

- Advanced monitoring and analytics
- Workflow visualization and debugging
- Performance optimization and caching

### Workflow Engine Implementation

When workflow execution is triggered, the orchestrator implements the following core logic:

```python
def execute_workflow_engine(workflow_name, feature_name, arguments):
    # 1. Load workflow definition
    workflow_def = load_workflow_definition(f".cc-deck/config/workflows/{workflow_name}.yaml")

    # 2. Initialize or load Smart Context
    context = SmartContext(workflow_name, feature_name)
    context.load_existing_state()

    # 3. Determine starting phase
    current_phase = determine_current_phase(workflow_def, context)

    # 4. Execute workflow phases
    while current_phase:
        phase_def = workflow_def.phases[current_phase]

        # Phase-specific execution

### Integration with Existing Systems

The CC-Deck Workflow Engine maintains full compatibility with existing orchestrator functionality:

#### Kiro SDD Integration

- **Preserves** existing `.kiro/` directory structure
- **Enhances** tasks.md parsing and checkbox management
- **Maintains** compatibility with kiro_status.json
- **Extends** with Smart Context for cross-phase communication

#### Agent Integration

- **Utilizes** existing sub-agent definitions without modification
- **Enhances** with intelligent agent selection based on task content
- **Provides** richer context to agents through Smart Context
- **Maintains** existing Task() delegation patterns

### Error Handling and Recovery

The workflow engine includes comprehensive error handling:

```python
def handle_workflow_error(error, phase_name, context):
    """Handle workflow execution errors with recovery strategies"""

    # Log error details
    log_error(f"Workflow error in phase {phase_name}: {error}")

    # Create error checkpoint
    create_error_checkpoint(context, phase_name, error)

    # Determine recovery strategy
    if isinstance(error, AgentExecutionError):
        return retry_agent_execution(phase_name, context)
    elif isinstance(error, TaskFailureError):
        return handle_task_failure_recovery(error, context)
    elif isinstance(error, ApprovalTimeoutError):
        return handle_approval_timeout(error, context)
    else:
        return escalate_to_user(error, context)

def create_workflow_checkpoint(context, checkpoint_name):
    """Create recovery checkpoint for workflow state"""
    checkpoint_data = {
        "checkpoint_name": checkpoint_name,
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "workflow_context": context.data.copy(),
        "file_state": capture_file_checksums()
    }

    checkpoint_file = f".cc-deck/runtime/checkpoints/{context.workflow_id}-{checkpoint_name}.json"
    ensure_directory_exists(os.path.dirname(checkpoint_file))

    with open(checkpoint_file, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(checkpoint_data, f, indent=2)
```

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Workflow Execution

```bash
# Intelligent workflow selection based on project state
/orchestrator

# Explicit workflow with feature specification
/orchestrator "kiro-sdd user-authentication-system"

# Resume interrupted workflow
/orchestrator "resume user-authentication-system"
```

#### Advanced Workflow Control

```bash
# Force specific workflow regardless of project state
/orchestrator "workflow:coding feature:payment-api"

# Execute specific phase of workflow
/orchestrator "phase:implementation feature:user-auth"

# Workflow with custom parameters
/orchestrator "kiro-sdd mobile-app --tdd-approach --parallel-tasks=3"
```

The CC-Deck Workflow Engine integration represents a significant enhancement to the orchestrator's capabilities while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing functionality.

### Utility Functions and Helpers

The following utility functions support the CC-Deck Workflow Engine integration:

```python
def parse_tasks_md(tasks_file):
    """Parse tasks.md file and extract task information with checkbox status"""
    try:
