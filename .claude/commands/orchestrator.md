# Orchestrator Command

Intelligent orchestrator that automatically detects project state and continues development workflow from the appropriate phase using task-based progression.

## Purpose

This command serves as the single entry point for all development workflows by:

1. **Analyzing project state** (checking existing specifications, tasks.md files, code)
2. **Determining next phase** (identifying what needs to be done next)
3. **Delegating to appropriate agent** (executing the right workflow)
4. **Maintaining continuity** (preserving context between phases)

## Intelligent State Detection & Dynamic Agent Selection

### Automatic Project Analysis

When invoked without specific parameters, orchestrator will:

1. **Check for existing specifications** in `.kiro/specs/` directory
2. **Analyze tasks.md files** for active development tasks and completion status
3. **Review code changes** and implementation progress
4. **Determine current phase** and recommend next steps
5. **Select optimal agent** based on context and complexity

```bash
# Automatic state detection and continuation
/orchestrator

# Example output:
# üîç Analyzing project state...
# ‚úÖ Found feature: user-auth-system
# üìã Current phase: Implementation (7/12 tasks completed)
# üß† Context analysis: High complexity, security-critical
# üéØ Agent selection: tdd-agent (TDD approach for security)
# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  Proceeding with TDD implementation...
```

### Context-Based Agent Selection

Intelligent agent selection based on project context and requirements:

Based on project analysis, the orchestrator selects the most appropriate workflow agent:

- **Security-critical development**: Use `tdd-agent` for comprehensive security testing with TDD approach
- **Complex refactoring needs**: Use `refactoring` agent for systematic code improvement workflows
- **API or service development**: Use `integration-test` agent for comprehensive API testing
- **New feature development**: Use `coding` agent for full development lifecycle management
- **Documentation requirements**: Use `documentation-agent` for comprehensive documentation generation
- **Structured development**: Use `kiro-spec-orchestrator` for specification-driven development workflow

### Agent Selection Criteria

The orchestrator analyzes project characteristics to determine optimal delegation:

1. **Code complexity analysis**: Assess existing codebase complexity and maintenance needs
2. **Security requirements**: Identify authentication, authorization, and security-sensitive code
3. **Integration patterns**: Detect APIs, external services, and integration requirements
4. **Development phase**: Determine whether project needs research, implementation, testing, or documentation
5. **Quality status**: Assess current code quality and improvement opportunities

### Workflow Coordination

For complex scenarios requiring multiple workflows:

- **Refactoring + Testing**: Coordinate code improvement with comprehensive testing
- **Documentation + PR Creation**: Ensure documentation updates are included in pull requests
- **Implementation + Quality Assurance**: Combine development with continuous quality validation
- **Research + Planning**: Integrate technology research with strategic planning

The orchestrator ensures proper sequencing and context sharing between different workflow phases.

### State Detection Logic

```yaml
Project State Analysis:
  0. Check Serena MCP Status:
    - New project ‚Üí Initialize Serena MCP with mcp__serena__initial_instructions
    - Existing project ‚Üí Load context with mcp__serena__list_memories
    - Context stale ‚Üí Refresh project understanding

  1. Check Specifications:
    - No specs ‚Üí Start with Kiro Steering
    - Incomplete spec ‚Üí Resume from last phase
    - Complete spec ‚Üí Check tasks.md status

  2. Validate State Consistency:
    - Compare kiro_status.json with actual project state
    - Detect implementation ahead of kiro status
    - Detect approval blocks preventing progression
    - Auto-sync status when implementation detected

  3. Check Implementation (tasks.md):
    - No tasks.md ‚Üí Create tasks from specs
    - Incomplete tasks ‚Üí Continue with next uncompleted task
    - All tasks completed ‚Üí Ready for next feature/enhancement
    - Implementation exists but tasks unmarked ‚Üí Auto-update task progress

  4. Auto-Resolve Status Inconsistencies:
    - Detect created files/code vs task completion status
    - Auto-approve completed phases when implementation verified
    - Update kiro_status.json current_phase to match reality
    - Trigger TDD-agent completion when implementation done

  5. Check Next Work:
    - All tasks complete ‚Üí Analyze for new features or improvements
    - Tasks in progress ‚Üí Focus on current implementation
    - Blocked tasks ‚Üí Identify and resolve blockers

  6. Check Quality:
    - Implementation complete ‚Üí Run tests and validation
    - Tests failing ‚Üí Debug and fix issues
    - Tests passing ‚Üí Mark tasks as completed

  7. Check Documentation:
    - Code complete ‚Üí Update documentation
    - Documentation ready ‚Üí Final validation
    - All complete ‚Üí Ready for new work cycle
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Smart Workflow Continuation

1. **State Analysis Phase**

   ```bash
   # Analyze project structure
   - Check .kiro/specs/ directory for feature specifications
   - Read tasks.md files for implementation progress
   - Analyze task completion status (checkboxes)
   - Determine optimal next action
   ```

2. **Context Preservation**

   ```bash
   # Maintain workflow context
   - Feature name from existing specs
   - Current task from tasks.md progress
   - Completed tasks from checkbox status
   - Next logical task from task hierarchy
   ```

3. **Intelligent Delegation**
   ```bash
   # Delegate to appropriate phase (with Serena MCP integration)
   - New project ‚Üí Serena MCP initialization ‚Üí Kiro workflow
   - Missing specs ‚Üí Kiro workflow (Steering ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Tasks)
   - Missing tasks.md ‚Üí Generate implementation tasks
   - Incomplete tasks ‚Üí Continue implementation (with Serena context)
   - All tasks complete ‚Üí Identify next feature/enhancement
   - Code complete ‚Üí Testing and validation
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Continuation

```bash
# Continue from where you left off
/orchestrator

# Force specific phase
/orchestrator "continue coding user-auth-system"

# Start new feature
/orchestrator "Build a real-time chat application"
```

### Phase-Specific Execution

```bash
# Jump to specific phase
/orchestrator "kiro:spec-design user-auth"      # Continue with design
/orchestrator "create-issues payment-system"    # Create issues for existing spec
/orchestrator "coding authentication-module"    # Start implementation
/orchestrator "acceptance user-management"      # Run acceptance tests
/orchestrator "pr-merge 123"                   # Merge approved PR
```

## Workflow State Management

### State Files and Tracking

The orchestrator maintains project state through several mechanisms:

```yaml
State Storage:
  .kiro/specs/{feature}/kiro_status.json:
    - current_phase: "design|requirements|tasks|etc"
    - completed_phases: ["steering", "init", "requirements"]
    - last_updated: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    - next_recommended: "tasks"

  .claude/workflow-state.json:
    - active_feature: "user-auth-system"
    - active_issues: [123, 124, 125]
    - completed_issues: [120, 121, 122]
    - current_pr: 456
    - workflow_phase: "implementation"
```

### Automatic Next Step Detection

When `/orchestrator` is called without parameters:

1. **Scan for Active Features**

   ```bash
   # Check specs directory
   ls .kiro/specs/*/kiro_status.json
   # Identify features in progress
   # Select most recently updated
   ```

2. **Determine Current Phase**

   ```bash
   # Read kiro_status.json
   # Check completed vs pending phases
   # Identify blockers or dependencies
   ```

3. **Recommend Next Action**
   ```bash
   # Based on phase completion:
   - Steering done ‚Üí Requirements
   - Requirements done ‚Üí Design
   - Design done ‚Üí Tasks
   - Tasks created ‚Üí Implementation
   - All tasks complete ‚Üí Next Issue Selection
   - Issue selected ‚Üí New Kiro Workflow
   - Implementation done ‚Üí Testing
   - Testing done ‚Üí Acceptance
   - Acceptance done ‚Üí PR Creation
   - PR created ‚Üí Merge
   - Merged ‚Üí Next Issue
   ```

### Example Workflow Continuation

```bash
# First time - starts from beginning
/orchestrator
# Output: "No active features found. Starting with Kiro Steering..."

# After steering completed
/orchestrator
# Output: "Found project context. Proceeding with feature initialization..."

# After several phases completed
/orchestrator
# Output: "Feature 'user-auth' at Design phase. Continuing with task generation..."

# With active development
/orchestrator
# Output: "Found 3 incomplete tasks for 'user-auth'. Checking implementation progress..."
```

## Sub-Agent Architecture Benefits

- **Focused Responsibility**: Orchestrator handles state detection and delegation
- **Intelligent Continuation**: Automatically resumes from last successful phase
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains workflow state across sessions
- **Flexible Progression**: Allows jumping to specific phases when needed
- **Progress Visibility**: Clear indication of current state and next steps

This pattern enables seamless workflow continuation without manual state tracking.

## Tasks.md Progress Tracking Integration

### Task-Based Development Workflow

The orchestrator focuses on .kiro/specs/{feature}/tasks.md files for tracking implementation progress:

```bash
# Continue from current task progress
/orchestrator

# Update specific task completion
/orchestrator "complete-task feature-name 1.1"

# Work on next uncompleted task
/orchestrator "next-task feature-name"
```

### Core Task Management

- **Primary Focus**: Track progress through tasks.md checkbox completion
- **Automatic Detection**: Identify next uncompleted task automatically
- **Progress Visualization**: Display current completion status
- **Smart Continuation**: Resume from last incomplete task

### Tasks.md File Structure and Format

.kiro/specs/{feature}/tasks.md files follow a hierarchical checkbox format for tracking implementation progress:

```markdown

### Task Progress Update Process

#### Automatic Task Completion Detection

The orchestrator automatically detects task completion by:

1. **Analyzing Code Changes**: Comparing implemented functionality against task requirements
2. **Checking Test Coverage**: Verifying tests exist for completed tasks
3. **Validating Requirements**: Ensuring task acceptance criteria are met
4. **Updating Checkboxes**: Automatically updating `[ ]` to `[x]` for completed tasks

#### Manual Task Progress Updates

```bash
# Update specific task completion
/orchestrator "complete-task feature-name 1.1"

# Mark multiple tasks as completed
/orchestrator "complete-tasks feature-name 1.1,1.2,2.3"

# Update task progress with validation
/orchestrator "update-progress feature-name --validate"
```

#### Progress Tracking Commands

```bash
# Check current task progress
/orchestrator "task-status feature-name"

```

#### Integration with Development Workflow

The tasks.md progress tracking integrates seamlessly with the development workflow:

1. **Task Selection**: Automatically identifies next logical task to implement
2. **Context Preservation**: Maintains task context across development sessions
3. **Dependency Management**: Ensures prerequisite tasks are completed first
4. **Progress Continuity**: Resumes development from the last completed task

### Task Completion and Next Feature Workflow

#### Automatic Next Feature Identification

When all tasks in a tasks.md file are completed, the orchestrator automatically:

1. **Validates Complete Task Completion**: Ensures all checkboxes are marked as completed
2. **Analyzes Project State**: Reviews current codebase and documentation
3. **Identifies Improvements**: Suggests enhancements, optimizations, or new features
4. **Presents Options**: Shows potential next development areas
5. **Requests User Decision**: Waits for user direction on next focus area

```bash
# Automatic flow when tasks complete
/orchestrator
# Output: "All tasks completed for 'user-auth-system'!"
# Output: "Analyzing project for potential improvements..."
# Output: "Suggested next development areas:"
# Output: "1. Performance optimizations"
# Output: "2. UI/UX enhancements"
# Output: "3. Additional security features"
# Output: "4. New feature development"
# Output: "What would you like to focus on next?"
```

#### Manual Next Feature Selection

```bash
# Force next feature analysis
/orchestrator "next-feature feature-name"

# Suggest improvements for specific area
/orchestrator "suggest-improvements authentication"

# Start new feature development
/orchestrator "new-feature user-profile-management"
```
