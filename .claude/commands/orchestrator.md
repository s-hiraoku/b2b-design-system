# Orchestrator Command

Intelligent orchestrator that automatically detects project state and continues development workflow from the appropriate phase.

## Purpose

This command serves as the single entry point for all development workflows by:

1. **Analyzing project state** (checking existing specifications, issues, code)
2. **Determining next phase** (identifying what needs to be done next)
3. **Delegating to appropriate agent** (executing the right workflow)
4. **Maintaining continuity** (preserving context between phases)

## Intelligent State Detection

### Automatic Project Analysis

When invoked without specific parameters, orchestrator will:

1. **Check for existing specifications** in `specs/` directory
2. **Analyze GitHub issues** for active development tasks
3. **Review code changes** and PR status
4. **Determine current phase** and recommend next steps

```bash
# Automatic state detection and continuation
/orchestrator

# Example output:
# üîç Analyzing project state...
# ‚úÖ Found feature: user-auth-system
# üìã Current phase: Design completed
# üéØ Next recommended: Generate implementation tasks
# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  Proceeding with: /orchestrator "kiro:spec-tasks user-auth-system"
```

### State Detection Logic

```yaml
Project State Analysis:
  1. Check Specifications:
     - No specs ‚Üí Start with Kiro Steering
     - Incomplete spec ‚Üí Resume from last phase
     - Complete spec ‚Üí Check implementation status
  
  2. Check Implementation:
     - No issues ‚Üí Create issues from tasks
     - Open issues ‚Üí Check development progress
     - Completed issues ‚Üí Validate and test
  
  3. Check Quality:
     - No tests ‚Üí Generate tests
     - Failed tests ‚Üí Debug and fix
     - Passing tests ‚Üí Check acceptance status
  
  4. Check Deployment:
     - Not ready ‚Üí Complete prerequisites
     - Ready ‚Üí Create PR
     - PR open ‚Üí Check merge readiness
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Smart Workflow Continuation

1. **State Analysis Phase**
   ```bash
   # Analyze project structure
   - Check specs/ directory for feature specifications
   - Read kiro_status.json for phase tracking
   - Query GitHub for issue and PR status
   - Determine optimal next action
   ```

2. **Context Preservation**
   ```bash
   # Maintain workflow context
   - Feature name from existing specs
   - Current phase from status files
   - Completed work from git history
   - Next steps from workflow logic
   ```

3. **Intelligent Delegation**
   ```bash
   # Delegate to appropriate phase
   - Missing specs ‚Üí Kiro workflow
   - Missing issues ‚Üí Create issues
   - Open issues ‚Üí Development assistance
   - Complete code ‚Üí Testing and validation
   - Tested code ‚Üí PR and deployment
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Continuation
```bash
# Continue from where you left off
/orchestrator

# Force specific phase
/orchestrator "continue coding user-auth-system"

# Start new feature
/orchestrator "Build a real-time chat application"
```

### Phase-Specific Execution
```bash
# Jump to specific phase
/orchestrator "kiro:spec-design user-auth"      # Continue with design
/orchestrator "create-issues payment-system"    # Create issues for existing spec
/orchestrator "coding authentication-module"    # Start implementation
/orchestrator "acceptance user-management"      # Run acceptance tests
/orchestrator "pr-merge 123"                   # Merge approved PR
```

## Workflow State Management

### State Files and Tracking

The orchestrator maintains project state through several mechanisms:

```yaml
State Storage:
  specs/{feature}/kiro_status.json:
    - current_phase: "design|requirements|tasks|etc"
    - completed_phases: ["steering", "init", "requirements"]
    - last_updated: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    - next_recommended: "tasks"
  
  .claude/workflow-state.json:
    - active_feature: "user-auth-system"
    - active_issues: [123, 124, 125]
    - completed_issues: [120, 121, 122]
    - current_pr: 456
    - workflow_phase: "implementation"
```

### Automatic Next Step Detection

When `/orchestrator` is called without parameters:

1. **Scan for Active Features**
   ```bash
   # Check specs directory
   ls specs/*/kiro_status.json
   # Identify features in progress
   # Select most recently updated
   ```

2. **Determine Current Phase**
   ```bash
   # Read kiro_status.json
   # Check completed vs pending phases
   # Identify blockers or dependencies
   ```

3. **Recommend Next Action**
   ```bash
   # Based on phase completion:
   - Steering done ‚Üí Requirements
   - Requirements done ‚Üí Design
   - Design done ‚Üí Tasks
   - Tasks done ‚Üí Create Issues
   - Issues created ‚Üí Implementation
   - Implementation done ‚Üí Testing
   - Testing done ‚Üí Acceptance
   - Acceptance done ‚Üí PR Creation
   - PR created ‚Üí Merge
   - Merged ‚Üí Next Issue
   ```

### Example Workflow Continuation

```bash
# First time - starts from beginning
/orchestrator
# Output: "No active features found. Starting with Kiro Steering..."

# After steering completed
/orchestrator
# Output: "Found project context. Proceeding with feature initialization..."

# After several phases completed
/orchestrator
# Output: "Feature 'user-auth' at Design phase. Continuing with task generation..."

# With active development
/orchestrator
# Output: "Found 3 incomplete tasks for 'user-auth'. Checking implementation progress..."
```

## Sub-Agent Architecture Benefits
