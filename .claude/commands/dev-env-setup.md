# Development Environment Setup Command

Intelligent development environment setup workflow that analyzes Kiro SDD specifications and generates a unified enhanced-implementation-agent with integrated MCP capabilities to optimize the development process.

## Initial Setup: Current Date Information

**CRITICAL**: Always call the following agent first to execute the command correctly.

```bash
# First action: Get current date information
Task(subagent_type="date-utility", description="Get current date information", prompt="Please provide current date and time information for use in this dev-env-setup workflow session, including search-appropriate year formatting.")

# Second action: User interaction guidelines reminder
Task(subagent_type="user-interaction-reminder", description="User interaction guidelines", prompt="Provide critical reminders about proper user interaction protocols for this dev-env-setup workflow session.")
```

## üöÄ DEV-ENV-SETUP WORKFLOW EXECUTION

echo ""
# (Recommendations will be displayed by mcp-recommender output)
echo ""
echo "‚ùì Agent Generation Approval"
echo ""
echo "Please select your preference:"
echo "[A] approved - Generate all recommended agents"
echo "[M] approved_with_modifications - Select specific agents"
echo "[R] rejected - Skip agent generation, use standard workflow"
echo "[D] deferred - Save state and decide later"
echo ""
echo "Your choice:"

2. **Claude Code System Agent**: Use .claude/agents/ directory for system recognition with unique project naming
3. **Unified MCP Integration**: Include all approved MCP tools in single agent
4. **Proper YAML frontmatter**: name: {project_id}-enhanced-implementation-agent, tools with all MCPs
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when MCP tools unavailable
6. **Project-specific customization**: Align with actual technology stack

Agent Design:
- Single file: {project_id}-enhanced-implementation-agent.md
- Integrated MCP capabilities: Context7, DeepWiki, Serena, and approved tools
