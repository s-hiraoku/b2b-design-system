# Development Environment Setup Command

Intelligent development environment setup workflow that analyzes Kiro SDD specifications and dynamically generates project-specific MCP SubAgents to optimize the development process.

## Initial Setup: Current Date Information

**CRITICAL**: Always start by calling the date-utility agent to get accurate current date and time information for proper timestamping, search queries, and time-sensitive operations.

```bash
# First action: Get current date information
Task(subagent_type="date-utility", description="Get current date information", prompt="Please provide current date and time information for use in this dev-env-setup workflow session, including search-appropriate year formatting.")

# Second action: User interaction guidelines reminder
Task(subagent_type="user-interaction-reminder", description="User interaction guidelines", prompt="Provide critical reminders about proper user interaction protocols for this dev-env-setup workflow session.")
```

## Workflow Engine Implementation

This command implements a YAML-driven workflow engine that reads `.cc-deck/config/workflows/dev-env-setup.yaml` and executes phases sequentially with Smart Context propagation.

### Core Execution Logic

1. **Load Workflow Definition**: Parse `dev-env-setup.yaml`
2. **Initialize Smart Context**: Create context for cross-phase communication  
3. **Execute Sequential Phases**: Run each phase with appropriate SubAgent
4. **Handle Human Interactions**: Present approval workflows when required
5. **Create Dynamic Directories**: Generate project-specific directory structures
6. **Propagate Context**: Share results between phases for intelligent execution

### Implementation

```yaml
# Workflow execution starts here
workflow_name: dev-env-setup-workflow
project_id: [auto-detected from .kiro/specs or user input]

phases:
  1. spec_analysis (spec-analyzer SubAgent)
  2. mcp_recommendation (mcp-recommender SubAgent)  
  3. user_approval (human interaction)
  4. agent_generation (agent-generator SubAgent)
  5. workflow_integration (workflow-integrator SubAgent)
  6. human_approval_dev_env (human interaction)
```

## Automatic Workflow Execution

When this command is executed:

1. **Project Detection**: Automatically detect active project from `.kiro/specs/` 
2. **Workflow Loading**: Load and parse `dev-env-setup.yaml`
3. **Context Initialization**: Create Smart Context for the detected project
4. **Phase Execution**: Execute phases in sequence using Task() calls to SubAgents
5. **Directory Creation**: Create dynamic directory structure during execution
6. **Result Integration**: Merge results into enhanced Coding workflow configuration

## Overview

The Development Environment Setup workflow bridges the gap between specification completion (Kiro SDD) and implementation (Coding) by creating customized development tools and integrations tailored to the specific project's technology stack and requirements.

## Workflow Execution Process

### Phase 1: Specification Analysis
- **Agent**: spec-analyzer
- **Purpose**: Extract technology stack and development requirements from Kiro SDD specifications
- **Inputs**: `.kiro/specs/{project_id}/` directory contents
- **Outputs**: Technology stack analysis, integration opportunities, development context

### Phase 2: MCP Recommendation
- **Agent**: mcp-recommender  
- **Purpose**: Research and recommend optimal MCP-based SubAgents for the project
- **Research Methods**: Web search, documentation analysis, technology stack matching
- **Outputs**: Prioritized recommendations with rationale and estimated benefits

### Phase 3: User Approval
- **Type**: Human interaction
- **Purpose**: Review and approve recommended MCP agents
- **Decision Options**: approved, approved_with_modifications, rejected, deferred
- **Timeout**: 48 hours

### Phase 4: Agent Generation
- **Agent**: agent-generator
- **Purpose**: Generate approved MCP SubAgents with proper CC-Deck integration
- **Naming Convention**: `{project_id}-{agent_purpose}`
- **Output Directory**: `.cc-deck/config/workflows/dynamic/{project_id}/agents/`

### Phase 5: Workflow Integration
- **Agent**: workflow-integrator
- **Purpose**: Create extension configurations and merge with base Coding workflow
- **Integration Strategy**: Array addition to supporting_agents
- **Outputs**: Extension config, merged workflow configuration

### Phase 6: Human Approval
- **Type**: Human interaction
- **Purpose**: Final review of generated development environment
- **Next Workflow**: Coding (with enhanced agent configuration)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Automatic project detection from current context
/dev-env-setup

# After Kiro SDD completion, this will:
# 1. Analyze the completed specifications
# 2. Research optimal MCP integrations
# 3. Generate project-specific agents
# 4. Prepare enhanced Coding workflow
```

### Explicit Project Specification  
```bash
# Specify project for development environment setup
/dev-env-setup "liquid-glass-tech-blog"

# Target specific technology optimization
/dev-env-setup "Next.js + Vercel deployment optimization"
```

## Expected Outputs

### Generated MCP Agents (Examples)
```bash
# For Next.js + Vercel + Supabase project
.cc-deck/config/workflows/dynamic/my-project/agents/
├── my-project-vercel-agent.md          # Deployment optimization
├── my-project-nextjs-optimizer.md      # App Router performance
├── my-project-supabase-helper.md       # Database integration
└── my-project-tailwind-helper.md       # CSS optimization
```

### Workflow Integration Files
```bash
.cc-deck/config/workflows/dynamic/my-project/
├── extensions/
│   └── coding-extension.yaml           # Extension configuration
└── generated/
    └── coding-merged.yaml              # Enhanced Coding workflow
```

## Technology Stack Support

The mcp-recommender agent dynamically researches and identifies optimal MCP integrations based on the project's specific technology stack and requirements, rather than relying on pre-defined categories. This ensures recommendations are current and tailored to the actual project needs.

## 🚀 WORKFLOW ENGINE EXECUTION

*Implementing live workflow execution with YAML-driven phase management*

I'll now implement the actual workflow engine execution logic. This will:

1. **Auto-detect project from .kiro/specs/ directory**
2. **Load workflow definition from YAML**
3. **Create dynamic directory structure** 
4. **Execute phases sequentially with Task() calls**
5. **Handle user approval workflows**
6. **Manage Smart Context between phases**

Let me detect the active project and start workflow execution:
