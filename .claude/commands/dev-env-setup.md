# Development Environment Setup Command

Intelligent development environment setup workflow that analyzes Kiro SDD specifications and dynamically generates project-specific MCP SubAgents to optimize the development process.

## Workflow Engine Implementation

This command implements a YAML-driven workflow engine that reads `.cc-deck/config/workflows/dev-env-setup.yaml` and executes phases sequentially with Smart Context propagation.

### Core Execution Logic

1. **Load Workflow Definition**: Parse `dev-env-setup.yaml`
2. **Initialize Smart Context**: Create context for cross-phase communication  
3. **Execute Sequential Phases**: Run each phase with appropriate SubAgent
4. **Handle Human Interactions**: Present approval workflows when required
5. **Create Dynamic Directories**: Generate project-specific directory structures
6. **Propagate Context**: Share results between phases for intelligent execution

### Implementation

```yaml
# Workflow execution starts here
workflow_name: dev-env-setup-workflow
project_id: [auto-detected from .kiro/specs or user input]

phases:
  1. spec_analysis (spec-analyzer SubAgent)
  2. mcp_recommendation (mcp-recommender SubAgent)  
  3. user_approval (human interaction)
  4. agent_generation (agent-generator SubAgent)
  5. workflow_integration (workflow-integrator SubAgent)
  6. human_approval_dev_env (human interaction)
```

## Automatic Workflow Execution

When this command is executed:

1. **Project Detection**: Automatically detect active project from `.kiro/specs/` 
2. **Workflow Loading**: Load and parse `dev-env-setup.yaml`
3. **Context Initialization**: Create Smart Context for the detected project
4. **Phase Execution**: Execute phases in sequence using Task() calls to SubAgents
5. **Directory Creation**: Create dynamic directory structure during execution
6. **Result Integration**: Merge results into enhanced Coding workflow configuration

## Overview

The Development Environment Setup workflow bridges the gap between specification completion (Kiro SDD) and implementation (Coding) by creating customized development tools and integrations tailored to the specific project's technology stack and requirements.

## Workflow Execution Process

### Phase 1: Specification Analysis
- **Agent**: spec-analyzer
- **Purpose**: Extract technology stack and development requirements from Kiro SDD specifications
- **Inputs**: `.kiro/specs/{project_id}/` directory contents
- **Outputs**: Technology stack analysis, integration opportunities, development context

### Phase 2: MCP Recommendation
- **Agent**: mcp-recommender  
- **Purpose**: Research and recommend optimal MCP-based SubAgents for the project
- **MCP Integrations**: Brave Search, DeepWiki MCP, Context7 MCP
- **Outputs**: Prioritized recommendations with rationale and estimated benefits

### Phase 3: User Approval
- **Type**: Human interaction
- **Purpose**: Review and approve recommended MCP agents
- **Decision Options**: approved, approved_with_modifications, rejected, deferred
- **Timeout**: 48 hours

### Phase 4: Agent Generation
- **Agent**: agent-generator
- **Purpose**: Generate approved MCP SubAgents with proper CC-Deck integration
- **Naming Convention**: `{project_id}-{agent_purpose}`
- **Output Directory**: `.cc-deck/config/workflows/dynamic/{project_id}/agents/`

### Phase 5: Workflow Integration
- **Agent**: workflow-integrator
- **Purpose**: Create extension configurations and merge with base Coding workflow
- **Integration Strategy**: Array addition to supporting_agents
- **Outputs**: Extension config, merged workflow configuration

### Phase 6: Human Approval
- **Type**: Human interaction
- **Purpose**: Final review of generated development environment
- **Next Workflow**: Coding (with enhanced agent configuration)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Automatic project detection from current context
/dev-env-setup

# After Kiro SDD completion, this will:
# 1. Analyze the completed specifications
# 2. Research optimal MCP integrations
# 3. Generate project-specific agents
# 4. Prepare enhanced Coding workflow
```

### Explicit Project Specification  
```bash
# Specify project for development environment setup
/dev-env-setup "liquid-glass-tech-blog"

# Target specific technology optimization
/dev-env-setup "Next.js + Vercel deployment optimization"
```

## Expected Outputs

### Generated MCP Agents (Examples)
```bash
# For Next.js + Vercel + Supabase project
.cc-deck/config/workflows/dynamic/my-project/agents/
├── my-project-vercel-agent.md          # Deployment optimization
├── my-project-nextjs-optimizer.md      # App Router performance
├── my-project-supabase-helper.md       # Database integration
└── my-project-tailwind-helper.md       # CSS optimization
```

### Workflow Integration Files
```bash

- **File Operations**: Light (agent and config generation)
- **Memory Usage**: Low to moderate
- **Network**: Required for MCP research phase

## Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Complete Kiro SDD First**: Ensure specifications are thorough and approved
2. **Review Recommendations**: Carefully evaluate suggested MCP agents for relevance
3. **Consider Complexity**: Balance optimization benefits with development complexity
4. **Approve Thoughtfully**: Select agents that provide genuine value for your workflow

### For System Integration
1. **Context Preservation**: Maintain clear project context throughout workflow
2. **Error Tolerance**: Handle MCP service failures gracefully
3. **User Experience**: Provide clear explanations and rationale for recommendations
4. **Quality Focus**: Prioritize working integrations over comprehensive coverage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Missing Specifications**: Ensure Kiro SDD workflow completed successfully
- **MCP Service Timeouts**: Network connectivity required for research phase
- **Permission Errors**: Verify write access to workflow configuration directories
- **Agent Naming Conflicts**: System handles conflicts with automatic resolution

### Resolution Steps
1. **Verify Prerequisites**: Check Kiro SDD completion and specification availability
2. **Check Network**: Ensure MCP services are accessible
3. **Validate Permissions**: Confirm write access to configuration directories
4. **Review Logs**: Check workflow execution logs for specific error details

This command creates a seamless bridge between specification and implementation, ensuring your development environment is optimized for your specific project's needs and technology stack.
