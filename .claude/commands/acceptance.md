You are the **Acceptance Workflow Command** that executes comprehensive human approval processes with AI-assisted review preparation and feedback-driven coordination.

## Initial Setup: Current Date Information

**CRITICAL**: Always start by calling the date-utility agent to get accurate current date and time information for proper timestamping, search queries, and time-sensitive operations.

```bash
# First action: Get current date information
Task(subagent_type="date-utility", description="Get current date information", prompt="Please provide current date and time information for use in this acceptance workflow session, including search-appropriate year formatting.")

# Second action: User interaction guidelines reminder
Task(subagent_type="user-interaction-reminder", description="User interaction guidelines", prompt="Provide critical reminders about proper user interaction protocols for this acceptance workflow session.")
```

## Command Purpose

This command initiates and manages the acceptance workflow, which facilitates human stakeholder approval through AI-prepared review materials and manages feedback-driven development coordination.

## Human-First Approval Policy

**ALL changes require human stakeholder approval** - this is a mandatory quality gate. AI assists by preparing comprehensive review materials, but humans make all final decisions.

## Workflow Execution

⚠️ **Final Approval Required**

This workflow follows approval checkpoints defined in `.cc-deck/config/workflows/acceptance.yaml`.

**Final Stage**: This is the completion of the complete development workflow chain. Approval marks formal project completion.

### Implementation Logic:

1. **Complete Current Workflow**: Execute all acceptance phases
2. **Wait for Human Approval**: Present comprehensive review materials
3. **Upon Approval**: Project formally completed
4. **Final Status**: Development workflow chain completed successfully

```bash
# After acceptance workflow completion and approval:
# 1. Read .cc-deck/config/workflows/acceptance.yaml
# 2. Complete final approval process
# 3. Project development workflow chain is complete
# 4. Document final completion status
```

### Execution Steps:

**CRITICAL**: Execute ALL phases sequentially using the specified agents. Do NOT skip phases.

1. **Phase 1**: acceptance-reviewer (Prepare comprehensive review materials for human acceptance)
2. **Phase 2**: Human review and decision process (72-hour structured stakeholder review)
3. **Phase 3**: Conditional routing based on decision:
   - **Approved**: → Project completion
   - **Rejected**: → Phase 4 (Feedback analysis)
4. **Phase 4**: feedback-analyzer (Systematic analysis of rejection feedback and root cause identification)
5. **Phase 5**: phase-coordinator (Coordinate rollback and re-execution of development phases)
6. **Phase 6**: Final completion or re-execution monitoring

**Important**: Each phase must be completed by the designated agent before proceeding to the next phase.

## Acceptance Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Review Preparation

- **Agent**: acceptance-reviewer
- **Purpose**: Prepare comprehensive review materials for human stakeholders
- **Preparation Scope**:
  - **Feature Demonstration**: Interactive demos and usage examples
  - **Quality Assessment**: Code quality metrics and test coverage analysis
  - **Documentation Package**: Complete feature documentation and API specs
  - **Risk Assessment**: Security, performance, and integration risk evaluation
- **Outputs**: Review package, quality metrics, demonstration materials, risk reports

### Phase 2: Human Review Process

- **Type**: human_interaction (72-hour window)
- **Purpose**: Structured human review with stakeholder participation
- **Review Process**:
  - **Stakeholder Presentation**: Scheduled demo and feature walkthrough
  - **Interactive Q&A**: Facilitated discussion and clarification session
  - **Decision Collection**: Structured voting and feedback gathering
- **Decision Options**: Approved, Approved with Conditions, Rejected, Deferred
- **Participants**: Product Owner (required), Technical Lead (required), QA Lead (optional)

### Phase 3: Decision Processing

- **Type**: Conditional routing based on approval decision
- **Routing Logic**:
  - **Approved**: → Acceptance Completion
  - **Approved with Conditions**: → Condition Addressing
  - **Rejected**: → Feedback Analysis
  - **Deferred**: → Deferral Management

## Rejection Handling Workflow

### Phase 4: Feedback Analysis

- **Agent**: feedback-analyzer
- **Purpose**: Systematic analysis of rejection feedback and root cause identification
- **Analysis Categories**:
  - **Functional Issues**: Requirements gaps and implementation problems
  - **Quality Concerns**: Technical debt and code quality issues
  - **User Experience**: Interface design and usability problems
  - **Performance Issues**: Optimization needs and scalability concerns
  - **Security Concerns**: Vulnerability identification and mitigation needs
- **Outputs**: Categorized feedback, root cause analysis, phase impact mapping

### Phase 5: Phase Coordination

- **Agent**: phase-coordinator
- **Purpose**: Coordinate rollback and re-execution of development phases
- **Coordination Activities**:
  - **Rollback Planning**: Systematic phase rollback strategy
  - **Re-execution Strategy**: Updated implementation approach
  - **Resource Reallocation**: Efficient resource redistribution
  - **Timeline Adjustment**: Realistic schedule updates
- **Rollback Strategies**:
  - Requirements Issues → Rollback to `kiro-sdd-workflow`
  - Implementation Problems → Rollback to `coding-workflow`
  - Quality Issues → Rollback to `refactoring-workflow` or `testing-workflow`

### Phase 6: Re-execution Monitoring

- **Agent**: phase-coordinator
- **Purpose**: Monitor and guide re-execution of development phases
- **Monitoring Scope**:
  - **Progress Tracking**: Real-time phase execution monitoring
  - **Quality Metrics**: Continuous quality assessment and improvement
  - **Stakeholder Communication**: Regular progress updates and risk communication
- **Outputs**: Progress reports, quality improvements, completion status

## Approval Path Workflows

### Conditional Approval Path

- **Phase**: Condition Addressing
- **Agent**: acceptance-reviewer
- **Purpose**: Address specific conditions for conditional approval
- **Activities**: Condition resolution planning, implementation timeline, validation criteria
- **Outcome**: → Acceptance Completion

### Deferral Management Path

- **Phase**: Deferral Management
- **Agent**: acceptance-reviewer
- **Purpose**: Manage deferred acceptance with follow-up scheduling
- **Activities**: Follow-up scheduling, preparation requirements, stakeholder communication
- **Outcome**: Rescheduled review process

### Acceptance Completion

- **Phase**: Final completion and documentation
- **Agent**: acceptance-reviewer
- **Purpose**: Complete acceptance process and document outcomes
- **Activities**: Final documentation, stakeholder notification, process metrics capture
- **Outputs**: Acceptance certificate, lessons learned, next recommendations

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Feature acceptance review
/acceptance "Review and approve user authentication system implementation"

# Post-development quality approval
/acceptance "Stakeholder approval for e-commerce checkout enhancement"

# Security feature acceptance
/acceptance "Security review and approval for payment processing integration"

# API acceptance review
/acceptance "Review and approve REST API design and implementation"

# Performance enhancement approval
/acceptance "Stakeholder approval for database optimization improvements"
```

## Human Interaction Management

### Stakeholder Coordination

- **Required Participants**: Product Owner, Technical Lead
- **Optional Participants**: QA Lead, Business Stakeholders (conditional)
- **Review Format**: Structured demo, comprehensive documentation, facilitated Q&A
