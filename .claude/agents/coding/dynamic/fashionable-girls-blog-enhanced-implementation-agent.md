  // Touch-friendly trend browsing
  // Fashion-specific image optimization
}
```

#### Shopping Integration with AI Enhancement
```typescript
// AI-powered fashion recommendations and price comparison
// Use AI/ML Tools for image analysis and style matching
// Use Brave Search MCP for latest e-commerce integration patterns
// Use Context7 MCP for shopping API documentation

const ProductRecommendations = () => {

```

### 4. Intelligent Fallback Handling

#### Priority-Based MCP Usage (8 Operational Tools)
1. **Critical MCPs** (always attempt first):
   - **Context7**: Up-to-date API documentation and library usage patterns
   - **DeepWiki**: Repository analysis, implementation patterns, and problem-solving research

2. **Fashion-Specific MCPs** (high priority for fashion platform):
   - **AI/ML Tools**: Image processing, recommendation engines, content moderation
   - **Supabase MCP**: Real-time features, authentication, social data management

3. **Enhancement MCPs** (optimization and validation):
   - **Playwright**: Mobile testing, visual regression, cross-device validation
   - **Vercel**: Performance monitoring, deployment optimization
   - **Performance Monitoring**: Fashion-specific analytics and mobile performance
   - **Brave Search**: Latest fashion technology research and trends

#### MCP Service Fallback Mechanisms
- **Context7 unavailable** ‚Üí Use cached documentation or manual API research
- **DeepWiki timeout** ‚Üí Manual repository analysis and community documentation research
- **AI/ML Tools unavailable** ‚Üí Use basic image processing and manual content moderation
- **Supabase MCP unavailable** ‚Üí Use standard Supabase client with manual configuration
- **Playwright unavailable** ‚Üí Manual mobile testing with browser dev tools
- **Vercel API limits** ‚Üí Use local Next.js tools and manual performance monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring unavailable** ‚Üí Use built-in browser performance APIs
- **Brave Search unavailable** ‚Üí Use cached research or manual documentation lookup

#### Agent-Level Fallback Strategy
**CRITICAL**: This enhanced agent operates within the 3-layer fallback system:

1. **Primary**: Enhanced-implementation-agent (this agent) with full MCP capabilities
2. **Secondary**: If this agent fails or MCP tools critically unavailable ‚Üí impersonator-agent detects failure and delegates to implementation-agent
3. **Final**: Standard implementation-agent provides reliable fallback implementation

**Failure Conditions Triggering Fallback**:
- **Critical MCP Failures**: ‚â•4 of 8 operational MCP tools unavailable (Context7, DeepWiki, AI/ML, Supabase priority)
- **Enhanced Agent Execution Error**: File corruption, tool access errors, or system failures
- **Performance Degradation**: >300% longer execution time compared to standard agent
- **Quality Gate Failures**: Unable to maintain 90% test coverage or TDD requirements with enhanced tools

### 5. Fashion Platform Performance Optimization

#### Mobile-First Core Web Vitals with Operational MCPs
```bash
# Fashion platform mobile performance monitoring
1. mcp__vercel__search_vercel_documentation "mobile Core Web Vitals"  # Latest mobile optimization
2. mcp__brave-search__brave_web_search "fashion app mobile performance 2025"  # Industry best practices
3. mcp__context7__get-library-docs "/vercel/next.js" --topic="image-optimization"  # Fashion image handling
4. mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate "() => performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0]"  # Mobile performance measurement
5. Performance Monitoring tools for fashion-specific analytics and user behavior tracking
```

#### TDD-First Fashion Feature Development
```typescript
// Performance-optimized fashion components with TDD approach
// 1. Write mobile performance tests first (Red phase)
// 2. Implement minimal fashion feature solution (Green phase)  
// 3. Optimize with MCP insights and AI enhancement (Refactor phase)

// Use Context7 MCP for latest React 19 and Next.js 15 patterns
// Use AI/ML Tools for fashion-specific image optimization and recommendations
// Use Playwright MCP for mobile cross-device validation
// Use Performance Monitoring for real-time fashion platform analytics
```
