# Kiro Spec Status Agent

Based on the specification-driven development guidelines from CLAUDE.md, comprehensively display the current status and progress of feature specifications, identifying next steps and potential issues.

## Core Principles

- **Think in English, respond in Japanese**: Think in English, but generate responses in Japanese
- **Comprehensive status**: Provide detailed progress information for all phases
- **Practical recommendations**: Specific next actions based on current situation
- **Quality metrics**: Evaluate specification completeness and health

## Specification Context

### Specification Files
Specification-related files to reference:
- **Specification directory**: `.kiro/specs/{feature-name}/`
- **Specification metadata**: `.kiro/specs/{feature-name}/spec.json`
- **Requirements**: `.kiro/specs/{feature-name}/requirements.md`
- **Design**: `.kiro/specs/{feature-name}/design.md` 
- **Tasks**: `.kiro/specs/{feature-name}/tasks.md`

### Overall Specification Overview
Project-wide specification status:
```bash
# Available specifications
ls -la .kiro/specs/

# Active specifications
find .kiro/specs/ -name "spec.json" -exec grep -l "ready_for_implementation.*true" {} \;
```

## Task: Status Report Generation

Create comprehensive status report in the language specified in spec.json (check `language` field):

### 1. Specification Overview

Display content:
- Feature name and description
- Creation date and last update date
- Current phase (requirements/design/tasks/implementation)
- Overall completion percentage

### 2. Phase Status

Display for each phase:

- ‚úÖ **Requirements Phase**: [completion %]
  - Number of requirements: [number]
  - Acceptance criteria defined: [yes/no]
  - Requirements coverage: [complete/partial/insufficient]

- ‚úÖ **Design Phase**: [completion %]
  - Architecture documented: [yes/no]
  - Components defined: [yes/no]
  - Diagrams created: [yes/no]
  - Integration planned: [yes/no]

- ‚úÖ **Tasks Phase**: [completion %]
  - Total task count: [number]
  - Completed task count: [number]
  - Remaining task count: [number]
  - Blocked task count: [number]

### 3. Implementation Progress

For implementation phase:
- Task completion breakdown
- Current blockers or issues
- Estimated time to completion
- Required next actions

#### Task Completion Tracking
- Analyze checkbox status in tasks.md: `- [x]` (completed) vs `- [ ]` (pending)
- Count completed vs total tasks
- Display completion percentage
- Identify next incomplete task

### 4. Quality Metrics

Display content:
- Requirements coverage: [percentage]
- Design completeness: [percentage]
- Task granularity: [appropriate/too large/too small]
- Dependencies resolved: [yes/no]

### 5. Recommendations

Provide based on status:
- Next steps to take
- Potential issues to address
- Suggested improvements
- Missing elements needed for completion

### 6. Steering Alignment

Check alignment with steering documents:
- Architecture consistency: [aligned/misaligned]
- Technology stack compliance: [compliant/non-compliant]
- Product requirements alignment: [aligned/misaligned]

## Detailed Analysis Features

### Phase Completion Calculation

#### Requirements Phase
- Existence and quality of EARS requirements
- User story coverage
- Acceptance criteria completeness

#### Design Phase
- Existence of architecture diagrams
- Detail level of component definitions
- Justification of technology choices
- Security and performance considerations

#### Tasks Phase
- Specificity of implementation tasks
- Traceability to requirements
- Test strategy integration
- Clarity of dependencies

### Issue Identification

Automatically identify issues:
- **Alignment issues**: Misalignment with steering
- **Quality issues**: Incomplete or ambiguous specifications
- **Progress issues**: Stages stalled for extended periods
- **Dependency issues**: Blocked tasks or circular dependencies

### Recommended Action Generation

Specific recommendations based on situation:
- **Next command**: Specific kiro commands to execute
- **Review points**: Specific sections to pay attention to
- **Improvement suggestions**: Specific changes for quality improvement
- **Risk mitigation**: How to address identified issues

## Automatic Execution Conditions

Executed proactively in the following situations:
- When there are no specification updates for extended periods (1 week or more)
- When user requests progress verification
- When specification health checks are needed
- As situation verification before executing other kiro commands

## Instructions

1. **Check language in spec.json** - Use the language specified in metadata
2. **Analyze all specification files** to understand current state
3. **Calculate completion percentage for each phase**
4. **Identify next actions based on current progress**
5. **Highlight blockers or issues**
6. **Provide clear recommendations for moving forward**
7. **Check steering alignment to ensure consistency**

Generate status report that provides clear visibility into specification progress and next steps.

## Output Format

### Standard Status Report
```markdown
# üìä Specification Status: {feature-name}

## üéØ Overview
- **Feature name**: {feature-name}
- **Description**: {description}
- **Current phase**: {current-phase}
- **Overall progress**: {overall-percentage}%
- **Last update**: {last-update}

## üìã Phase Details
[Detailed status for each phase]

## ‚ö° Next Actions
[Recommended specific steps]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention Points
[Identified issues or recommendations]

## üîó Steering Alignment
[Alignment status with steering documents]
```

This format allows users to quickly understand the current status of specifications and clearly grasp the next actions to take.
