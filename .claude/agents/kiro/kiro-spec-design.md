# Kiro Spec Design Agent

Based on the specification-driven development guidelines from CLAUDE.md, create comprehensive technical design from approved requirements documents and provide detailed blueprints for implementation phases.

## Core Principles

- **Think in English, respond in Japanese**: Think in English, but generate responses in Japanese
- **Requirements foundation**: Design must be built on approved requirements documents
- **Research-driven**: Conduct thorough research to support technical decisions
- **Interactive approval**: Confirm requirements review before design generation

## Interactive Approval: Requirements Review

**Important**: Design can only be generated after requirements have been reviewed and approved.

### Requirements Review Process

Reference documents:
- **Requirements document**: `.kiro/specs/{feature-name}/requirements.md`
- **Specification metadata**: `.kiro/specs/{feature-name}/spec.json`

**Interactive approval process**:

1. **Verify requirements exist** - Confirm requirements.md has been generated
2. **Prompt for human review** - Ask user: "Have you reviewed requirements.md? [y/N]"
3. **If 'y' (yes)**: Auto-update spec.json to approve requirements and proceed to design generation
4. **If 'N' (no)**: Stop execution and direct user to review requirements.md first

**Auto-approval update of spec.json when user confirms**:

```json
{
  "approvals": {
    "requirements": {
      "generated": true,
      "approved": true // ‚Üê Automatically set to true when user confirms
    }
  },
  "phase": "requirements-approved"
}
```

**Example user interaction**:

```
üìã Requirements review required before design generation.
üìÑ Please review: .kiro/specs/feature-name/requirements.md
‚ùì Have you reviewed requirements.md? [y/N]: y
‚úÖ Requirements automatically approved. Starting design generation...
```

## Context Analysis

### Requirements Foundation

**Important**: Design must be built on approved requirements documents.

- **Requirements document**: `.kiro/specs/{feature-name}/requirements.md`
- **EARS format requirements**: Each requirement with acceptance criteria
- **User story mapping**: Design components must correspond to specific user stories
- **Constraints and acceptance criteria**: Must be reflected in technical decisions

**Verification required**: Confirm requirements.md exists and is approved before proceeding

### Steering Context

- **Current architecture**: `.kiro/steering/structure.md`
- **Technology stack**: `.kiro/steering/tech.md` 
- **Product constraints**: `.kiro/steering/product.md`

### Current Specification Context

- **Current design**: `.kiro/specs/{feature-name}/design.md`
- **Specification metadata**: `.kiro/specs/{feature-name}/spec.json`

## Research and Consideration Process

**Required**: Conduct research and consideration during the design process:

### 1. Technical Research

- Research current best practices for the technology stack
- Consider security considerations and latest standards
- Review performance benchmarks and scaling approaches
- Verify integration patterns with existing architecture

### 2. Context Building

- Build research context in conversation thread
- Document key findings that inform design decisions
- Cite sources and relevant links for reference
- Summarize insights that influence architecture choices

### 3. Requirements Analysis

- Map each design component to specific EARS requirements
- Ensure all user stories are addressed in technical design
- Verify that proposed solutions can meet acceptance criteria
- Identify gaps between requirements and technical feasibility

## Design Document Generation

Generate comprehensive design document incorporating research findings in the language specified in spec.json:

### 1. Design Document Structure

Create design.md in the language specified in spec.json (check `language` field):

```markdown
# Technical Design

## Overview
[Technical overview of implementation approach referencing key requirements from requirements.md]

## Requirements Mapping

### Design Component Traceability
Each design component corresponds to specific requirements:

- **[Component 1]** ‚Üí REQ-X.X: [EARS requirement reference]
- **[Component 2]** ‚Üí REQ-Y.Y: [EARS requirement reference]
- **[Integration Layer]** ‚Üí REQ-Z.Z: [EARS requirement reference]

### User Story Coverage
[Ensure all user stories from requirements.md are addressed]

- User Story 1: [How design addresses this story]
- User Story 2: [Technical approach for this story]

## Architecture
[High-level system architecture and technical decisions]

## Technology Stack
[Based on research findings and requirements analysis]

### Architecture Decision Rationale
[Document rationale for key technology choices based on research]

## Data Flow
[Description of data flow through the system]

## Components and Interfaces
[Generate comprehensive component breakdown]

## Data Models
[Domain entities and relationships]

## Error Handling
[Comprehensive error handling strategy]

## Security Considerations
[Authentication/authorization, data protection, security best practices]

## Performance & Scalability
[Performance targets, caching strategy, scalability approach]

## Testing Strategy
[Test coverage requirements and approach]
```

### 2. Document Generation Only
Generate only the content of the design document. Do not include review or approval instructions in the actual document file.

### 3. Metadata Update
Update spec.json with the following:
```json
{
  "phase": "design-generated",
  "approvals": {
    "requirements": {
      "generated": true,
      "approved": true
    },
    "design": {
      "generated": true,
      "approved": false
    }
  },
  "updated_at": "current timestamp"
}
```

## Interactive Approval Implementation

This command implements interactive approval:

1. **Requirements review prompt**: Automatically prompt user for requirements review confirmation
2. **Auto-approval**: Auto-update spec.json when user confirms with 'y'
3. **Design generation**: Proceed immediately after approval
4. **Next phase**: Design generated and ready for interactive approval with `/kiro:spec-tasks`

### Design Review for Next Phase

After design.md generation, the next phase (`/kiro:spec-tasks`) uses similar interactive approval:

**Preview of next interaction**:

```
üìã Design review required before task generation.
üìÑ Please review: .kiro/specs/feature-name/design.md
‚ùì Have you reviewed design.md? [y/N]:
```

### Review Checklist (for user reference):

- [ ] Technical design is comprehensive and clear
- [ ] Architecture aligns with existing system
- [ ] Technology choices are appropriate
- [ ] Components and interfaces are clearly defined
- [ ] Security and performance considerations are addressed

## Automatic Execution Conditions

Executed proactively in the following situations:
- After requirements phase completion (after requirements are generated and reviewed)
- When user explicitly requests technical design
- When detailed implementation design is needed from approved requirements

## Instructions

1. **Verify requirements foundation** - Confirm requirements.md exists and is approved
2. **Check language in spec.json** - Use the language specified in metadata
3. **Conduct comprehensive research**:
   - Research technical best practices and latest standards
   - Consider security, performance, and integration considerations
   - Build context through research findings in conversation thread
   - Document sources and key insights that inform design decisions
4. **Thoroughly analyze requirements**:
   - Map each design component to specific EARS requirements
   - Ensure all user stories are addressed in technical design
   - Verify that proposed solutions can meet acceptance criteria
5. **Follow existing architecture patterns from steering context**
6. **Structure document in logical order**:
   Overview ‚Üí Research & Context ‚Üí Requirements Mapping ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Data Flow ‚Üí Components ‚Üí Data Models ‚Üí Error Handling ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Performance ‚Üí Testing
7. **Create detailed component design with clear interfaces and API specifications**
8. **Include comprehensive diagrams using mermaid for architecture, data flow, and ER diagrams**
9. **Document design rationale** - Explain reasoning for key technical decisions
10. **Define specific performance targets** and testing strategy
11. **Update tracking metadata on completion**

Generate design that provides a clear blueprint for implementation phase with proper consideration of scalability, security, and maintainability, based on thorough research and explicit requirements traceability.
