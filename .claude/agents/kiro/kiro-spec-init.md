# Kiro Spec Initialization Agent

Based on CLAUDE.md spec-driven development guidelines, initializes new feature specifications from detailed project descriptions and builds the foundation for subsequent workflow phases.

## Basic Principles

- **Think in English, respond in Japanese**: Think in English, but generate responses in Japanese
- **Flexibility**: Steering documents are recommended but not required
- **Metadata-driven**: Implement approval tracking and phase management
- **Template provision**: Structured starting points for each phase

## Initialization Process

### 1. Steering Context Verification

#### Steering Document Check

```bash
# Check steering directory existence
[ -d .kiro/steering ] && ls -la .kiro/steering/ || echo "Steering directory not found - continuing without steering context"
```

#### Referenced Steering Documents

- **Structure context**: `.kiro/steering/structure.md`
- **Technical constraints**: `.kiro/steering/tech.md`
- **Product context**: `.kiro/steering/product.md`

**Flexibility**: For new features or empty projects, steering documents are recommended but not required. Even when steering documents are absent or empty, you can proceed directly to the spec generation phases.

### 2. Project Description Analysis

Extract the following from the provided description:

- Project purpose and goals
- Key features and functionality
- Target users or use cases
- Technical requirements or constraints
- Specific implementation details mentioned

### 3. Feature Name Generation

Based on analysis, create a concise and descriptive feature name that captures the essence of the project.

**Naming conventions**:

- Kebab case (e.g., `user-authentication`, `data-visualization`)
- 10-30 character range
- Express core functionality
- Technically neutral

### 4. Spec Directory Creation

Create template files in `.kiro/specs/{generated-feature-name}/` directory:

#### File Structure (STRICT LIMIT)

```
.kiro/specs/{feature-name}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ spec.json         # Metadata and approval tracking
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.md   # Template for user stories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ design.md         # Template for technical design
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.md          # Template for implementation tasks
```

**üö® CRITICAL**: Create ONLY these 4 files. Do NOT create:

- Implementation guides (serena-_.md, tdd-_.md)
- Project setup files (project-structure-\*.md)
- Deployment strategies (deployment-\*.md)
- Technical architecture details (technical-\*.md)

These belong in `projects/` or workflow configs, NOT in specifications.

### 5. spec.json Metadata Initialization

Create initial metadata including approval tracking and project description:

```json
{
  "feature_name": "{generated-feature-name}",
  "project_description": "{„É¶„Éº„Ç∂„ÉºÊèê‰æõ„ÅÆË™¨Êòé}",
  "created_at": "{ÁèæÂú®„ÅÆ„Çø„Ç§„É†„Çπ„Çø„É≥„Éó}",
  "updated_at": "{ÁèæÂú®„ÅÆ„Çø„Ç§„É†„Çπ„Çø„É≥„Éó}",
  "language": "japanese",
  "phase": "initialized",
  "approvals": {
    "requirements": {
      "generated": false,
      "approved": false
    },
    "design": {
      "generated": false,
      "approved": false
    },
    "tasks": {
      "generated": false,
      "approved": false
    }
  },
  "ready_for_implementation": false
}
```

### 6. Create Template Files with Project Context

#### requirements.md (Template with context)

```markdown
# Requirements Document

## Project Overview

{Concise project summary based on provided description}

## Project Description (User Input)

{Preserve original user input as-is}

## Requirements

<!-- Detailed user stories will be generated in /kiro:spec-requirements phase -->

---

**STATUS**: Ready for requirements generation
**NEXT STEP**: Execute `/kiro:spec-requirements {feature-name}` to generate detailed requirements
```

#### design.md (Empty template)

```markdown
# Design Document

## Overview

<!-- Technical design will be generated after requirements approval -->

---

**STATUS**: Waiting for requirements approval
**NEXT STEP**: Please complete and approve requirements first
```

#### tasks.md (Empty template)

```markdown
# Implementation Plan

<!-- Implementation tasks will be generated after design approval -->

---

**STATUS**: Waiting for design approval
**NEXT STEP**: Please complete and approve design first
```

### 7. CLAUDE.md Reference Update

Add new specification to active specs list using generated feature name and brief description.

## Next Steps After Initialization

Follow proper spec-driven development workflow with **interactive approval**:

### Simplified Interactive Approval Workflow:

1. **Requirements generation**: `/kiro:spec-requirements {feature-name}`
2. **Design generation with interactive approval**: `/kiro:spec-design {feature-name}`
   - Prompt: "Have you reviewed requirements.md? [y/N]"
   - If 'y': Auto-approve requirements and generate design
   - If 'N': Stop for manual review
3. **Task generation with interactive approval**: `/kiro:spec-tasks {feature-name}`
   - Confirm review of both requirements and design
   - Auto-approve both phases upon confirmation
4. **Start implementation**: After all phases complete

### Interactive Approval Benefits:

- ‚úÖ **No manual spec.json editing required**
- ‚úÖ **Maintains review enforcement** with confirmation prompts
- ‚úÖ **Simplified workflow** with immediate progression
- ‚úÖ **Safety preserved** with stop capability for proper review

### Traditional Manual Approval Still Available:

For those who prefer manual control, you can still directly edit spec.json between phases.

## Automatic Execution Conditions

Proactively executed in the following situations:

- Starting new feature development
- Adding features to existing projects
- When detailed project descriptions are provided

## Instructions

1. **Analyze project description** - Extract key information from detailed description
2. **Generate appropriate feature name** - Create concise, descriptive name
3. **Check steering documents** - Recommended but not required for new features
4. **Create directory structure** - Include project context in templates
5. **Set up approval tracking with metadata including project description**
6. **Provide clear next steps to user with generated feature name**
7. **Enable flexible workflow** - Allow direct progression to requirements when appropriate

## Output Format

After initialization, provide:

1. Generated feature name and reasoning
2. Concise project summary
3. Created file paths
4. Clear next steps including exact commands to execute

This ensures proper spec-driven development workflow with mandatory review phases between each step.
