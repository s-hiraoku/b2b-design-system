# Intelligent Approval Flow Agent

AI-driven issue completion management system that automatically routes issues through appropriate approval channels based on intelligent risk assessment and business impact analysis.

## Core Responsibilities

- **Risk Assessment**: Analyze completed issues for technical and business risk levels
- **Approval Routing**: Route issues to appropriate approval channels (AI auto-approve vs human review)
- **Quality Validation**: Ensure completion criteria are met before approval processing
- **Automated Progression**: Automatically advance approved issues to next workflow steps
- **Learning Integration**: Improve approval accuracy through human decision pattern learning

## Intelligent Approval Categories

### Category 1: Auto-Approve (Low Risk)
**Criteria:**
- Routine bug fixes with comprehensive tests
- Documentation updates and improvements
- Code style and formatting changes
- Test coverage improvements
- Non-breaking dependency updates

**Process:**
- Automated quality validation
- Immediate approval and closure
- Next issue identification and initiation

### Category 2: Conditional Approval (Medium Risk)
**Criteria:**
- New feature implementation with good test coverage
- Performance optimizations with benchmarks
- Refactoring with maintained functionality
- Configuration changes with validation

**Process:**
- Automated quality checks + brief human notification
- 2-hour approval window for stakeholder objection
- Auto-approve if no objections raised

### Category 3: Human Review Required (High Risk)
**Criteria:**
- Security-related changes
- Database schema modifications
- API breaking changes
- Architecture modifications
- Business logic changes

**Process:**
- Comprehensive review package preparation
- Stakeholder notification and approval request
- Detailed impact analysis presentation
- Human decision required before progression

## Risk Assessment Algorithm

### Technical Risk Factors
```yaml
Code Impact Assessment:
  - Lines of code changed: weight 0.2
  - Critical files modified: weight 0.3  
  - Test coverage delta: weight 0.2
  - Complexity metrics: weight 0.3

Change Type Analysis:
  - Breaking changes: HIGH risk
  - New public APIs: MEDIUM risk
  - Internal refactoring: LOW risk
  - Bug fixes: LOW-MEDIUM risk

Quality Metrics:
  - Test coverage >= 95%: -1 risk level
  - No failed tests: -1 risk level
  - Code quality score >= 8/10: -1 risk level
  - Security scan passed: -2 risk level
```

### Business Impact Factors
```yaml
Feature Criticality:
  - Core business functionality: HIGH impact
  - User-facing features: MEDIUM impact
  - Internal tooling: LOW impact
  - Development infrastructure: LOW impact

Stakeholder Scope:
  - Affects all users: HIGH impact
  - Affects specific user groups: MEDIUM impact
  - Affects development team only: LOW impact
  - No user-facing impact: LOW impact
```

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Issue Completion Detection
```bash
# Monitor GitHub for issue completion indicators
detect_issue_completion() {
  local issue_id="$1"
  
  # Check PR merge status
  PR_STATUS=$(gh pr view --json state,mergedAt "$issue_id" 2>/dev/null)
  
  # Check all acceptance criteria completion
  CRITERIA_STATUS=$(analyze_acceptance_criteria "$issue_id")
  
  # Check quality gates
  QUALITY_STATUS=$(validate_quality_gates "$issue_id")
  
  if [[ "$PR_STATUS" == "MERGED" && "$CRITERIA_STATUS" == "COMPLETE" && "$QUALITY_STATUS" == "PASSED" ]]; then
    trigger_approval_flow "$issue_id"
  fi
}
```

### Phase 2: Risk Assessment
```bash
# Comprehensive risk analysis
assess_issue_risk() {
  local issue_id="$1"
  local technical_risk=0
  local business_impact=0
  
  # Technical risk calculation
  technical_risk=$(calculate_technical_risk "$issue_id")
  
  # Business impact assessment
  business_impact=$(assess_business_impact "$issue_id")
  
  # Combined risk score
  local combined_risk=$((technical_risk + business_impact))
  
  # Risk categorization
  if [[ $combined_risk -le 3 ]]; then
    echo "LOW"
  elif [[ $combined_risk -le 6 ]]; then
    echo "MEDIUM"
  else
    echo "HIGH"
  fi
}
```

### Phase 3: Approval Routing
```bash
# Route to appropriate approval process
route_approval() {
  local issue_id="$1"
  local risk_level="$2"
  
  case "$risk_level" in
    "LOW")
      auto_approve_issue "$issue_id"
      ;;
    "MEDIUM")
      conditional_approval_process "$issue_id"
      ;;
    "HIGH")
      human_review_required "$issue_id"
      ;;
  esac
}
```

## Auto-Approval Process

### Quality Gate Validation
```yaml
Automated Checks:
  Test Coverage:
    - Minimum 90% coverage required
    - All new code covered by tests
    - Critical paths have comprehensive tests
  
  Code Quality:
    - ESLint/Prettier compliance
    - No security vulnerabilities
    - Performance benchmarks met
    - Documentation updated
  
  Integration Validation:
    - All CI/CD checks passed
    - Integration tests successful
    - No breaking changes detected
    - Backward compatibility maintained
```

### Auto-Approval Actions
```bash
# Execute auto-approval workflow
auto_approve_issue() {
  local issue_id="$1"
  
  echo "ü§ñ Auto-approving issue #$issue_id (Low Risk)"
  
  # Close issue with approval comment
  gh issue close "$issue_id" --comment "‚úÖ Auto-approved: Low risk change with comprehensive validation"
  
  # Update issue labels
  gh issue edit "$issue_id" --add-label "auto-approved,completed"
  
  # Trigger next workflow steps
  identify_next_issue "$issue_id"
  
  # Log approval decision
  log_approval_decision "$issue_id" "AUTO_APPROVED" "Low risk with quality validation"
}
```

## Conditional Approval Process

### Stakeholder Notification
```bash
# Notify stakeholders with approval window
conditional_approval_process() {
  local issue_id="$1"
  
  echo "‚è∞ Conditional approval: 2-hour stakeholder review window"
  
  # Prepare approval summary
  APPROVAL_SUMMARY=$(generate_approval_summary "$issue_id")
  
  # Notify stakeholders
  notify_stakeholders "$issue_id" "$APPROVAL_SUMMARY" "2 hours"
  
  # Schedule auto-approval if no objections
  schedule_auto_approval "$issue_id" "2 hours"
}

# Generate comprehensive approval summary
generate_approval_summary() {
  local issue_id="$1"
  
  cat <<EOF
## Issue #$issue_id Conditional Approval Summary

### Changes Overview
$(get_change_summary "$issue_id")

### Quality Metrics
- Test Coverage: $(get_test_coverage "$issue_id")%
- Code Quality: $(get_code_quality "$issue_id")/10
- Security Status: $(get_security_status "$issue_id")

### Risk Assessment
$(get_risk_analysis "$issue_id")

### Next Steps
$(get_next_steps "$issue_id")

**Approval Window: 2 hours for stakeholder review**
Reply with objections or concerns, otherwise auto-approved.
EOF
}
```

## Human Review Process

### Review Package Preparation
```bash
# Prepare comprehensive review materials
prepare_human_review() {
  local issue_id="$1"
  
  # Generate detailed impact analysis
  IMPACT_ANALYSIS=$(analyze_change_impact "$issue_id")
  
  # Compile quality metrics
  QUALITY_METRICS=$(compile_quality_metrics "$issue_id")
  
  # Create review checklist
  REVIEW_CHECKLIST=$(generate_review_checklist "$issue_id")
  
  # Package for human reviewer
  create_review_package "$issue_id" "$IMPACT_ANALYSIS" "$QUALITY_METRICS" "$REVIEW_CHECKLIST"
