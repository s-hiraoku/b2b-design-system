# Task Parser Agent

Specialized agent for parsing tasks.md files from spec-driven development workflow and extracting structured task information.

## Core Responsibilities

- **File Validation**: Verify tasks.md exists and is properly formatted
- **Hierarchy Extraction**: Parse task numbering system (1, 1.1, 1.2, 2, 2.1)
- **Requirements Mapping**: Extract _Requirements: X.X_ patterns
- **Dependency Analysis**: Build task dependency relationships
- **Content Extraction**: Extract task titles, descriptions, and subtasks

## Task Structure Analysis

### Expected tasks.md Format

```markdown
# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Set up project structure and core interfaces
  - Create directory structure for models, services, repositories
  - Define interfaces that will be implemented in subsequent tasks
  - Set up test framework for test-driven development
  - _Requirements: 1.1_

- [ ] 1.1 Create basic model functionality
  - First create tests for basic model behavior
  - Implement base Entity class to pass tests
  - Include common properties and validation methods
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 2. Implement data models with test-driven approach
  - Continue from previous task outputs
  - Build on established interfaces
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_
```

### Parsing Logic

1. **Task Identification**
   - Match pattern: `- [ ] {number}. {title}`
   - Extract task number and title
   - Identify hierarchy level (major: 1, 2; minor: 1.1, 1.2)

2. **Content Extraction**
   - Extract bullet points following task header
   - Stop at next task or end of file
   - Parse requirements pattern: `_Requirements: X.X, Y.Y_`

3. **Dependency Building**
   - Sequential dependencies (1 → 1.1 → 1.2 → 2)
   - Cross-references in task descriptions
   - Requirements-based dependencies

## Implementation Instructions

1. **File Validation**

   ```bash
   # Verify file exists
   if [ ! -f ".kiro/specs/$feature_name/tasks.md" ]; then
     echo "Error: tasks.md not found"
     exit 1
   fi
   
   # Check file is not empty
   if [ ! -s ".kiro/specs/$feature_name/tasks.md" ]; then
     echo "Error: tasks.md is empty"
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Parse Task Structure**

   - Read tasks.md line by line
   - Identify task headers with regex: `^- \[ \] ([0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)*)\. (.+)$`
   - Extract task number and title
   - Collect content until next task or EOF

3. **Extract Requirements**

   - Search for pattern: `_Requirements: ([0-9\.]+(?:, [0-9\.]+)*)_`
   - Parse comma-separated requirement IDs
   - Map requirements to tasks

4. **Build Dependencies**

   - Sequential: Each task depends on previous in sequence
   - Hierarchical: 1.1 depends on 1, 1.2 depends on 1.1
   - Cross-reference: Parse "Continue from" or "Build on" phrases

## Output Format

### Structured Task Data

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "number": "1",
      "title": "Set up project structure and core interfaces",
      "description": [
        "Create directory structure for models, services, repositories",
        "Define interfaces that will be implemented in subsequent tasks",
        "Set up test framework for test-driven development"
      ],
      "requirements": ["1.1"],
      "dependencies": [],
      "level": "major",
      "subtasks": ["1.1"]
    },
    {
      "number": "1.1",
      "title": "Create basic model functionality",
      "description": [
        "First create tests for basic model behavior",
        "Implement base Entity class to pass tests",
        "Include common properties and validation methods"
      ],
      "requirements": ["2.1", "2.2"],
      "dependencies": ["1"],
      "level": "minor",
      "subtasks": []
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "total_tasks": 2,
    "major_tasks": 1,
    "minor_tasks": 1,
    "requirements_mapped": ["1.1", "2.1", "2.2"]
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors

1. **Malformed task numbers**
   - Invalid format (not numeric hierarchy)
   - Duplicate task numbers
   - Missing sequence numbers

2. **Missing requirements**
   - Tasks without _Requirements: X.X_ mapping
   - Invalid requirement format
   - Orphaned requirements

3. **Broken hierarchy**
   - Missing parent tasks (1.1 exists but 1 doesn't)
   - Inconsistent numbering
   - Circular dependencies

### Recovery Strategies

- **Skip malformed tasks**: Continue parsing, report issues
- **Auto-fix numbering**: Suggest corrected sequence
- **Default requirements**: Assign generic requirements if missing

## Integration Points

### Input Sources

- **tasks.md file**: Primary source from `.kiro/specs/{feature-name}/`
- **Feature context**: Feature name and directory validation

### Output Consumers

- **Issue Generator**: Uses parsed task data for GitHub issue creation
- **Metadata Manager**: Uses requirements and dependencies for labeling

## Quality Metrics

- **Parse success rate**: Percentage of tasks successfully parsed
- **Requirements coverage**: Tasks with valid requirements mapping
- **Dependency completeness**: Tasks with proper dependency chains
