# Project State Analyzer Agent

## Purpose

This agent provides comprehensive analysis of current project state to inform workflow selection and progress tracking across all development phases.

## Analysis Scope

### üîç Project Structure Analysis
- **Kiro SDD Specifications**: Check `.kiro/specs/` for active features and specifications
- **Implementation Status**: Analyze `projects/` directory for existing implementations  
- **Task Progress**: Parse `tasks.md` files for completion status and progress tracking
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Detect project-specific workflow configurations

### üìã Progress Tracking
- **Incomplete Tasks**: Identify uncompleted tasks from checkbox status in `tasks.md`
- **Implementation Gaps**: Detect missing implementations based on specifications
- **Quality Status**: Assess code quality, test coverage, and technical debt
- **Enhancement Opportunities**: Identify areas for improvement and optimization

### üéØ Workflow Recommendations
- **Next Phase Detection**: Determine appropriate next development phase
- **Agent Selection**: Recommend optimal sub-agents based on project context
- **Priority Assessment**: Rank tasks and features by importance and dependencies
- **Resource Requirements**: Estimate time and complexity for remaining work

## Analysis Framework

### Comprehensive State Detection Logic

Execute detailed project state analysis using the following step-by-step process:

```yaml
Project State Analysis Protocol:
  0. Serena MCP Status Check:
    - Check for new project requiring Serena MCP initialization
    - Load existing project context from mcp__serena__list_memories
    - Assess context freshness and project understanding status
    
  1. Dev-Env-Setup Status Analysis:
    - Detect complete Kiro specs with missing dynamic configuration
    - Check projects/* directory for existing implementations
    - Identify projects needing project-specific workflow configuration
    - Assess readiness for implementation vs configuration gaps
    
  2. Kiro SDD Specifications Analysis:
    - Scan .kiro/specs/ directory for active specifications
    - Check completion status: steering ‚Üí requirements ‚Üí design ‚Üí tasks
    - Identify incomplete specifications requiring phase completion
    - Validate specification consistency and completeness
    
  3. State Consistency Validation:
    - Compare kiro_status.json with actual project implementation state
    - Detect implementation progress ahead of recorded kiro status
    - Identify approval blocks preventing workflow progression
    - Auto-sync capabilities when implementation detected ahead of status
    
  4. Implementation Progress Analysis:
    - Parse .kiro/specs/{feature}/tasks.md files for checkbox completion
    - Identify uncompleted tasks requiring immediate attention
    - Detect implementation files/code vs unmarked task completion
    - Calculate overall progress percentages and completion metrics
    
  5. Status Inconsistency Auto-Resolution:
    - Detect created files and code implementations vs task completion status
    - Identify completed phases when implementation evidence exists
    - Recommend kiro_status.json current_phase updates to match reality
    - Suggest TDD-agent completion triggers when implementation verified
    
  6. Next Work Priority Analysis:
    - Identify next logical tasks when current tasks are complete
    - Analyze options for new features, improvements, and enhancements
    - Focus determination for in-progress vs blocked vs completed tasks
    - Resource allocation recommendations for optimal workflow progression
    
  7. Quality Assessment Integration:
    - Validate implementation completeness with test execution
    - Debug and fix recommendations for failing tests
    - Task completion confirmation when tests pass successfully
    - Quality gate enforcement for workflow progression
    
  8. Documentation and Completion Analysis:
    - Assess documentation completeness relative to code implementation
    - Validate documentation currency and accuracy
    - Final validation readiness for new development work cycles
    - Complete project state assessment for continuation decisions
```

### Detailed Analysis Implementation

When invoked, execute these specific analysis steps:

1. **File System Deep Scan**
```bash
# Comprehensive file system analysis
- Glob('.kiro/specs/*') ‚Üí Active Kiro specifications detection
- Glob('projects/*') ‚Üí Implementation status verification  
- Read('.kiro/specs/*/kiro_status.json') ‚Üí Phase completion status
- Read('.kiro/specs/*/tasks.md') ‚Üí Task-level progress analysis
- LS('.cc-deck/config/workflows/dynamic/*') ‚Üí Dynamic configuration status
```

2. **Task Progress Deep Analysis**
```python
# Detailed task analysis logic
def analyze_task_progress():
    for spec_dir in glob_pattern('.kiro/specs/*'):
        tasks_file = f"{spec_dir}/tasks.md"
        if file_exists(tasks_file):
            tasks = parse_tasks_md(tasks_file)
            incomplete_tasks = [task for task in tasks if not task['completed']]
            # Detailed analysis of incomplete vs completed ratios
            # Priority assessment for next task execution
            # Dependency mapping for optimal task ordering
```

3. **Project Context Analysis**
```python
# Implementation vs specification consistency check
def validate_implementation_consistency():
    - Check projects/{project-name}/src/ for implementation files
    - Cross-reference with tasks.md completion checkboxes
    - Identify implementation ahead of task completion marking
    - Generate recommendations for status synchronization
```

## Execution Protocol

When invoked, execute this comprehensive analysis sequence:

### Phase 1: Initial State Detection
```bash
# Step 1: Check for existing project structures
Glob('.kiro/specs/*') # Identify active Kiro specifications
Glob('projects/*')    # Check for implementation directories
LS('.cc-deck/config/workflows/dynamic/') # Dynamic configuration status
```

### Phase 2: Detailed Project Analysis
```bash
# Step 2: Analyze each active specification
for each_spec in .kiro/specs/*:
    Read('${each_spec}/kiro_status.json')  # Phase completion status
    Read('${each_spec}/tasks.md')          # Task progress analysis
    Read('${each_spec}/requirements.md')   # Requirements validation
    Read('${each_spec}/design.md')         # Design completeness
```

### Phase 3: Implementation Status Validation
```bash
# Step 3: Cross-reference implementation with specifications
for each_project in projects/*:
    LS('${each_project}/src/')           # Source code structure
    LS('${each_project}/')               # Project files (package.json, etc.)
    Grep('class|function|interface', '${each_project}/src/**/*') # Implementation detection
```

### Phase 4: Task Progress Calculation
```bash
# Step 4: Detailed task analysis per specification
for each_tasks_file in .kiro/specs/*/tasks.md:
    # Parse checkbox completion: [x] vs [ ]
    # Count completed vs total tasks
    # Identify next uncompleted task
    # Assess implementation evidence vs task marking
```

### Phase 5: Consistency Validation
```bash
# Step 5: Validate status consistency
# Compare:
#   - kiro_status.json current_phase
#   - Actual file implementation evidence
#   - Task completion checkboxes
#   - Project file structures
# Identify discrepancies requiring resolution
```

### Phase 6: Generate Analysis Report

### Critical Analysis Points

**Mandatory Checks:**
1. **Serena MCP Status**: Verify project context initialization
2. **Dev-Env-Setup Gap**: Identify missing dynamic configurations
3. **Task-Implementation Sync**: Detect completion marking discrepancies
4. **Workflow Readiness**: Assess prerequisites for next workflow phase
5. **Quality Gates**: Validate test coverage and implementation completeness

**Auto-Resolution Recommendations:**
- Update kiro_status.json when implementation evidence exists
- Mark completed tasks when implementation files verified
- Suggest Serena MCP initialization for new projects
- Trigger dev-env-setup for missing configurations

This protocol ensures every workflow starts with complete, accurate project context and actionable recommendations for optimal progression.
