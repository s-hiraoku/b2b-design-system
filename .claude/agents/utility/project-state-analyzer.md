# Project State Analyzer Agent

## Purpose

This agent provides comprehensive analysis of current CC-Deck Workflow Engine execution state to detect interrupted workflows and enable intelligent continuation. It analyzes workflow context, Smart Context Propagation state, and task-driven execution progress to determine the exact continuation point for any workflow.

## Analysis Scope

### üîç CC-Deck Workflow Engine State Analysis with Smart Context Integration

- **Active Workflows**: Check `.cc-deck/runtime/global/context/active/` for ongoing workflow execution states
- **Smart Context Loading**: Load existing Smart Context from `.cc-deck/runtime/global/context/` to avoid redundant analysis
- **Workflow Definitions**: Analyze `.cc-deck/config/workflows/` YAML definitions and dynamic configurations
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Use Smart Context to build upon previous insights and cached project analysis
- **Dynamic Agent Configurations**: Detect generated MCP SubAgents in `.cc-deck/runtime/projects/`

### üìã Workflow Execution Tracking

- **Current Phase Detection**: Identify exact phase and step within active workflows
- **Context State Validation**: Verify Smart Context data integrity and completion status
- **Task-Driven Progress**: Parse `tasks.md` integration and task execution status
- **Checkpoint Analysis**: Detect available recovery points and continuation options

### üéØ Continuation Strategy Recommendations

- **Workflow Resume Point**: Determine exact continuation phase and required inputs
- **Context Recovery**: Assess Smart Context validity and recovery requirements
- **Agent Selection**: Identify next agents based on workflow phase definitions
- **Dependency Resolution**: Check prerequisites and dependencies for continuation

## Analysis Framework

### Comprehensive State Detection Logic

Execute detailed project state analysis using the following step-by-step process:

```yaml
CC-Deck Workflow Engine State Analysis Protocol with Smart Context:
  0. Smart Context Initialization:
    - Check Smart Context availability: node .cc-deck/src/cli/smart-context-cli.js status
    - Load existing project context to avoid redundant analysis
    - Initialize new context if none exists
    - Gracefully fallback to standard analysis if Smart Context unavailable
    
  1. Active Workflow Detection:
    - Scan .cc-deck/runtime/global/context/active/ for ongoing workflow execution states
    - Parse workflow context files: {workflow}-{feature}.json format
    - Identify current phase, step, and execution status
    - Detect workflow interruption points and available recovery options

  1. Workflow Definition Analysis:
    - Load corresponding workflow YAML from .cc-deck/config/workflows/
    - Validate workflow structure and phase dependencies
    - Check for dynamic configurations in .cc-deck/runtime/projects/
    - Assess generated MCP SubAgent availability and integration status

  2. Smart Context Validation:
    - Parse Smart Context Propagation data integrity
    - Validate phase_outputs and context_data completeness
    - Check cross-phase data dependencies and availability

    - Check workflow-integrator output and merged configurations
    - Assess MCP service availability and integration status

  7. Continuation Strategy Formulation:
    - Determine optimal resume point based on analysis
    - Identify required context recovery or regeneration
    - Plan agent selection and execution sequence
    - Formulate continuation command and parameters

  8. Workflow Engine Compatibility Verification:

    - Check workflow definition format compatibility
    - Assess Smart Context Manager operational status
    - Verify Task-Driven Execution Engine integration
```

### Detailed Analysis Implementation

When invoked, execute these specific analysis steps:

1. **File System Deep Scan**

```bash
# CC-Deck Workflow Engine state analysis
- Glob('.cc-deck/runtime/global/context/active/*') ‚Üí Active workflow execution states
- Glob('.cc-deck/config/workflows/*.yaml') ‚Üí Available workflow definitions
- Glob('.cc-deck/runtime/projects/*') ‚Üí Dynamic agent configurations
- Read('.cc-deck/runtime/global/context/active/{workflow}-{feature}.json') ‚Üí Workflow state data
- LS('.cc-deck/runtime/global/checkpoints/') ‚Üí Available recovery checkpoints
```

2. **Task Progress Deep Analysis**

```python
# CC-Deck workflow state analysis logic
def analyze_workflow_execution_state():
    active_workflows = glob_pattern('.cc-deck/runtime/global/context/active/*')
    for workflow_context_file in active_workflows:
        workflow_context = parse_json(workflow_context_file)
        current_phase = workflow_context['current_state']['phase']
        workflow_definition = load_workflow_yaml(workflow_context['workflow_name'])
        
        # Analyze phase progression and next steps
        next_phase = determine_next_phase(current_phase, workflow_definition)
        required_context = check_phase_dependencies(next_phase, workflow_context)
        continuation_strategy = formulate_continuation_plan(workflow_context, next_phase)
```

3. **Project Context Analysis**

```python
# Workflow context vs execution state consistency check
def validate_workflow_consistency():
    - Check Smart Context data vs actual workflow progress
    - Cross-reference phase completion with workflow definition requirements
    - Identify context corruption or missing data scenarios
    - Generate recovery strategies for workflow continuation
```

## Execution Protocol

When invoked, execute this comprehensive analysis sequence:

### Phase 1: Smart Context and Workflow State Detection

```bash
# Step 1: Initialize Smart Context integration
Bash("node .cc-deck/src/cli/smart-context-cli.js status --project-id=$(basename $(pwd)) || echo 'Smart Context unavailable'")

# Step 2: Load existing Smart Context if available
Bash("node .cc-deck/src/cli/smart-context-cli.js load --project-id=$(basename $(pwd)) --scope=project_state,workflow_history || echo 'Creating new context'")

# Step 3: Check for active workflow execution states
Glob('.cc-deck/runtime/global/context/active/*') # Active workflow contexts
Glob('.cc-deck/config/workflows/base/*.yaml') # Available workflow definitions
LS('.cc-deck/runtime/projects/') # Dynamic agent configurations

# Step 4: Check DEV-ENV-SETUP completion by examining artifacts
# Extract project_id from current context or directory name
project_id = basename(pwd) or extract_from_context()

# Check for DEV-ENV-SETUP completion artifacts in .cc-deck/runtime/projects/{project_id}/
LS('.cc-deck/runtime/projects/{project_id}/agents/') # Generated MCP SubAgents
Read('.cc-deck/runtime/projects/{project_id}/extensions/coding-extension.yaml') # Workflow extension
Read('.cc-deck/runtime/projects/{project_id}/workflows/generated/coding-merged.yaml') # Merged workflow

# If all three exist, DEV-ENV-SETUP is complete and should recommend CODING workflow
```

### Phase 2: Detailed Workflow Analysis

```bash
# Step 2: Analyze each active workflow context
for each_workflow in .cc-deck/runtime/global/context/active/*:
    Read('${each_workflow}')                         # Workflow execution state
    workflow_name = extract_workflow_name(each_workflow)
    Read('.cc-deck/config/workflows/${workflow_name}.yaml') # Workflow definition
    Check_dynamic_config(workflow_name)              # Dynamic agent status

# Step 2.1: Check DEV-ENV-SETUP completion status
# DEV-ENV-SETUP is complete when these artifacts exist in .cc-deck/runtime/projects/{project_id}/:
project_id = extract_project_id_from_context()
dev_env_completion = check_dev_env_setup_completion(project_id):
    - agents/ directory with generated MCP SubAgents (*.md files)
    - extensions/coding-extension.yaml file
    - workflows/generated/coding-merged.yaml file
    
if dev_env_completion.all_artifacts_present():
    mark_workflow_as_complete("DEV-ENV-SETUP", project_id)
    recommend_next_workflow("CODING")
```

### Phase 3: Smart Context Validation

```bash
# Step 3: Validate Smart Context integrity and completeness
for each_context in workflow_contexts:
    validate_context_schema(each_context)           # Schema compliance
    check_phase_dependencies(each_context)          # Cross-phase data
    assess_continuation_readiness(each_context)     # Resume requirements
```

### Phase 4: Continuation Strategy Formulation

```bash
# Step 4: Determine optimal workflow continuation approach
for each_active_workflow in workflow_contexts:
    current_phase = extract_current_phase(each_active_workflow)
    next_phase = determine_next_phase(current_phase, workflow_definition)
    required_context = check_phase_requirements(next_phase)
    formulate_continuation_command(workflow_name, feature_name, next_phase)
```

### Phase 5: Recovery and Checkpoint Analysis

```bash
# Step 5: Analyze recovery options and checkpoint availability
# Compare:
#   - Smart Context current state
#   - Available checkpoint data
#   - Workflow definition requirements
#   - Dynamic agent availability
# Identify recovery strategies and rollback options
```

### Phase 6: Update Smart Context and Generate Analysis Report

```bash
# Step 6: Save analysis results to Smart Context for future use
Bash("node .cc-deck/src/cli/smart-context-cli.js update-analysis --project-id=$(basename $(pwd)) --analysis-results='${analysis_json}' || echo 'Analysis complete without context save'")
```

### Critical Analysis Points

**Mandatory Checks:**

1. **Active Workflow Detection**: Identify ongoing CC-Deck workflow executions
2. **DEV-ENV-SETUP Completion Detection**: Check `.cc-deck/runtime/projects/{project_id}/` for:
   - `agents/` directory with generated MCP SubAgent files (*.md)
   - `extensions/coding-extension.yaml` workflow extension file
   - `workflows/generated/coding-merged.yaml` merged workflow configuration
3. **Smart Context Validation**: Verify context data integrity and completeness
4. **Phase Continuation Readiness**: Assess next phase requirements and dependencies
5. **Dynamic Agent Availability**: Check generated MCP SubAgent operational status
6. **Recovery Point Assessment**: Validate checkpoint availability and currency

**Auto-Continuation Recommendations:**

- **DEV-ENV-SETUP Complete**: If `.cc-deck/runtime/projects/{project_id}/agents/`, `extensions/coding-extension.yaml`, and `workflows/generated/coding-merged.yaml` exist, recommend CODING workflow
- Resume workflows at detected continuation points
- Recover corrupted Smart Context from checkpoints
- Generate missing dynamic agents when required
- Trigger workflow chain progression (kiro-sdd ‚Üí dev-env-setup ‚Üí coding)

This protocol ensures CC-Deck Workflow Engine can intelligently detect, analyze, and continue interrupted workflows with complete context preservation and optimal execution strategies.
