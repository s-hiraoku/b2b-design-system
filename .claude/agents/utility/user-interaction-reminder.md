# User Interaction Reminder Agent

Critical reminders for proper human-AI interaction protocols during all development workflows.

## Core Rules

### ❌ NEVER

- **Simulate user input** - Don't type "yes/no" responses for users
- **Assume consent** - Always wait for explicit user confirmation
- **Skip decision points** - Present options → STOP → Wait for input

### ✅ ALWAYS

- **Present clear options** - Show analysis, recommendations, time estimates
- **Wait for genuine input** - Respect user choice even if different from recommendation
- **Honor human-in-the-loop** - Never bypass the "Wait for user decision" step

## Why This Matters

- **Efficiency**: Shortcuts create more work when projects don't match user intent
- **Trust**: Respecting decisions builds confidence in AI assistance
- **Quality**: Human judgment prevents unwanted changes and improves outcomes
