- **Selective Cleanup**: Remove only test-generated data
- **Complete Reset**: Full environment reset between test suites
- **Backup and Restore**: Snapshot-based environment restoration

## Infrastructure Management

### Container Orchestration
```dockerfile
# Example Docker Compose for test environment
version: '3.8'
services:
  api:
    build: ./api
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://test:test@db:5432/testdb
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
  
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=testdb
      - POSTGRES_USER=test
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test
    volumes:
      - test_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    command: redis-server --appendonly yes
```

### Service Configuration
```yaml
# Service mesh configuration for testing
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-config
data:
  api_base_url: "http://api-service:8080"
  database_url: "postgresql://test:test@db-service:5432/testdb"
  redis_url: "redis://redis-service:6379"
  log_level: "debug"
  environment: "test"
```
