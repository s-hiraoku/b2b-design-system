  timeout: number;
}

interface APITestCase {
  id: string;
  method: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE';
  endpoint: string;
  headers?: Record<string, string>;
  body?: any;
  expectedStatus: number;
  expectedResponse?: any;
  assertions: Assertion[];
}
```

}

interface E2ETestCase {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  steps: TestStep[];
  expectedOutcome: string;
  timeout: number;
  retryCount: number;
}
```

### Database Testing
```sql
-- Example database integration test
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Test data setup
INSERT INTO users (id, email, created_at) VALUES 
  (1, 'test@example.com', NOW());

-- Execute test scenario
INSERT INTO orders (user_id, amount, status) VALUES 
  (1, 99.99, 'pending');

-- Validate results
SELECT COUNT(*) as order_count 
FROM orders 
WHERE user_id = 1 AND status = 'pending';

-- Cleanup
ROLLBACK;
