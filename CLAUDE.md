# CC-Deck Project

## Overview
This is a development documentation project implementing the Kiro SDD (Specification-Driven Development) process. The project focuses on task management, issue creation, and development workflow optimization using Claude Code.

## Project Structure
- `docs/` - Project documentation
  - `claude-code/` - Claude Code specific documentation and guides
  - `kiro/` - Kiro SDD examples and specifications
- `README.md` - Main project workflow

## Development Workflow
The project follows a structured development process:
1. Implement Kiro SDD process
2. Break down tasks into GitHub issues
3. Execute issues with testing and implementation
4. Use orchestration, MCP, and similarity-ts tools
5. Perform refactoring and maintain code quality
6. Create and run E2E tests
7. Merge PRs and update documentation

## Commands
No specific build/test commands defined yet - this appears to be a documentation-focused project.

## Technologies
- Kiro SDD (Specification-Driven Development)
