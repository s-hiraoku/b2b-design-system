# Liquid Glass Tech Blog - Development Workflow

## Development Environment Setup Complete ✅

This project is now fully configured for TDD-first development with:

### Core Technologies
- **Next.js 15** with App Router and Turbopack
- **React 19** with latest features
- **TypeScript 5.x** with strict configuration
- **Tailwind CSS 4** with custom Liquid Glass utilities
- **Vitest** for unit testing with 95%+ coverage requirement
- **Playwright** for E2E testing with GPU acceleration
- **Storybook** with Liquid Glass component showcase

### Development Scripts

```bash
# Start development server with Turbopack
npm run dev

# Run both Next.js and Storybook concurrently
npm run dev:concurrent

# TDD mode with watch and coverage
npm run test:tdd

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Build and test E2E
npm run test:e2e

# Storybook development
npm run storybook

# Performance analysis build
npm run dev:performance

# Clean and reset environment
npm run clean

# Full setup verification
npm run setup
```

### TDD Workflow (Following t-wada Methodology)

1. **Red Phase**: Write failing test
   ```bash
   npm run test:tdd
   # Write test case that fails
   ```

2. **Green Phase**: Write minimal implementation
   ```bash
   # Keep tests running in watch mode
   # Write minimal code to pass test
   ```

3. **Refactor Phase**: Improve code quality
   ```bash
   # Keep tests passing
   # Refactor with confidence
   ```

### Liquid Glass Component Development

#### Test-First Development Pattern
```typescript
// 1. Write test first (Red)
describe('LiquidGlassNewComponent', () => {
  it('should render with default glass effect', () => {
    render(<LiquidGlassNewComponent />)
    const component = screen.getByTestId('new-component')
    expect(component).toHaveClass('backdrop-blur-md')
  })
})

// 2. Implement component (Green)
export const LiquidGlassNewComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div 
      data-testid="new-component" 
      className="backdrop-blur-md bg-white/10"
    >
      Component content
    </div>
  )
}

// 3. Refactor and enhance (Refactor)
```

### Storybook Development

All Liquid Glass components should have corresponding stories:

```typescript
// Component.stories.tsx
export default {
  title: 'LiquidGlass/ComponentName',
  component: ComponentName,
  parameters: {
    backgrounds: {
      default: 'dark'
    }
  }
}

export const Default = {}
export const WithInteraction = {
  args: { interactive: true }
}
export const SpringTheme = {
  args: { theme: 'spring' }
}
```

### Performance Requirements

- **Lines Coverage**: ≥95%
- **Branch Coverage**: ≥90%  
- **Function Coverage**: ≥95%
- **Statement Coverage**: ≥95%

### Quality Standards

1. **All code must be test-driven** using Red-Green-Refactor cycle
2. **Components must work in Storybook** before integration
3. **Performance budget**: 16ms per frame for animations
4. **Browser compatibility**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

```

### Development Best Practices

1. **Start with tests** - Never write implementation before tests
2. **Use Storybook** for component development and testing
3. **Performance first** - Monitor GPU usage and frame rates
4. **Accessibility always** - Test with screen readers
5. **Mobile responsive** - Test on different screen sizes

### Current Status

✅ Dependencies installed and updated  
✅ Storybook configured with Liquid Glass components  
✅ Testing infrastructure (Vitest + Playwright) working  
✅ Tailwind CSS 4 optimized for glass effects  
✅ Next.js 15 build process validated  
✅ Development scripts configured  
✅ TDD environment ready  

### Next Steps

Ready for continued implementation from the Storybook foundation:

1. Continue TDD development of remaining components
2. Implement seasonal theme system
3. Add particle effects system
4. Build MDX content management
5. Create AI image generation system

The environment is fully optimized for continuing the liquid glass tech blog implementation using strict TDD methodology.
