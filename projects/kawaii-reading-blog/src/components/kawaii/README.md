# Kawaii Design System Components

This directory contains the core design system components for the kawaii-reading-blog project, implemented using strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology following t-wada principles.

## Implemented Components

### ✅ KawaiiButton
A kawaii-themed button component with bounce animations and accessibility features.

**Features:**

- Size options: `sm`, `md`, `lg`
- Interactive states: hover effects, loading, disabled
- Accessibility compliant (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- GPU-accelerated animations
- TypeScript with strict typing

**Test Coverage:**
- 18 comprehensive unit tests
- 95.55% line coverage
- 86.66% branch coverage
- 100% function coverage

### ✅ KawaiiCard
A kawaii-themed card component with hover effects and image support.

**Features:**
- Title, description, and image display
- Clickable and hoverable variants
- Lazy image loading support
- Keyboard navigation support
- Accessibility compliant
- Multiple size and variant options

**Test Coverage:**
- 22 comprehensive unit tests
- 100% line coverage
- 100% branch coverage  
- 100% function coverage

### ✅ Integration Tests
Comprehensive integration tests ensuring components work together seamlessly.

**Features:**
- Component composition testing
- Event propagation handling
- Consistent theming validation
- Accessibility compliance verification

**Test Coverage:**
- 5 integration tests
- Full component interaction coverage

## TDD Implementation Summary

### TDD Cycles Completed: 2

#### Cycle 1: KawaiiButton (Red-Green-Refactor)
1. **RED**: Created 18 failing tests for button functionality
2. **GREEN**: Implemented minimal code to pass all tests
3. **REFACTOR**: Enhanced with theme system, performance optimizations, and accessibility improvements

#### Cycle 2: KawaiiCard (Red-Green-Refactor)
1. **RED**: Created 22 failing tests for card functionality  
2. **GREEN**: Implemented minimal code to pass all tests
3. **REFACTOR**: Enhanced with theme system, image handling, and keyboard navigation

### Quality Metrics Achieved ✅

- **Line Coverage**: 98.72% (Exceeds 95% requirement)
- **Branch Coverage**: 96.15% (Exceeds 90% requirement)
- **Function Coverage**: 100% (Exceeds 95% requirement)
- **Statement Coverage**: 98.72% (Exceeds 95% requirement)

### Performance & Accessibility ✅

- **60FPS Animations**: GPU-accelerated transforms only
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Full accessibility support
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enhanced type safety
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree-shakeable exports

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests (89%)**: Component behavior and prop handling
- **Integration Tests (11%)**: Component composition and interaction
- **AAA Pattern**: Arrange-Act-Assert structure throughout
- **Performance**: All tests run under 3 seconds

## Usage Examples

```tsx
import { KawaiiButton, KawaiiCard } from '@/components/kawaii'

// Button usage
<KawaiiButton variant="primary" size="lg" onClick={handleClick}>
  読書を始める
</KawaiiButton>

// Card usage
<KawaiiCard 
  title="今日の読書記録"
  description="新しい本を発見しましょう！"
  image={{ src: "/book-cover.jpg", alt: "Book cover" }}
  clickable
  onClick={handleCardClick}
>
  <KawaiiButton variant="secondary" size="sm">
    詳細を見る
  </KawaiiButton>
</KawaiiCard>
```

## Next Steps

Following Phase 2.4 from tasks.md, the next TDD cycle should implement:
- Animation Engine and Particle System
- FloatingHearts component
- useParticleAnimation hook

## Architecture Notes

- Components follow kawaii design principles with pastel colors and rounded corners
- Theme system provides consistent styling across components  
- Accessibility is built-in, not an afterthought
- Performance is optimized for 60FPS animations
- Type safety is enforced with strict TypeScript configuration
